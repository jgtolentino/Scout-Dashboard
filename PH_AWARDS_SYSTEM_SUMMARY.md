## Deployment Instructions

We've prepared a deployment folder to assist with the Azure Portal setup:

```
/Users/tbwa/azure_deployment/
├── README.md                    # Detailed deployment instructions
├── azure_portal_deployment.sql  # SQL script to run in Azure Portal
└── import_data.sh               # Script to import data after tables are created
```

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Database Setup**
   - Follow instructions in `/Users/tbwa/azure_deployment/README.md`
   - Execute the SQL script in Azure Portal Query Editor
   - Run the import script after tables are created

2. **Verify Full System Operation**
   - Run `/Users/tbwa/verify_ph_awards_setup.py` to verify the setup
   - Check that all components are working correctly
   - Test SQL queries for data integrity

3. **Run with Real Data**
   - Update the path to your actual PH Awards archive
   - Run the analyzer with real data:
     ```bash
     bash /Users/tbwa/run_enhanced_analysis.sh --archive /path/to/archive
     ```
   - Re-import the results to the database
