# Important Notice: Email Auto-Responder Status

## Current Issue

The auto-responder for job applications is currently operating in **simulation mode only** because the Zoho Mail API access is still limited. While we're waiting for the API to fully unlock after upgrading to the Workplace Standard Plan, you'll need to send confirmation emails manually.

## Temporary Solution

A manual email sender script has been created to help you respond to applications until the API becomes fully available:

```bash
/Users/tbwa/manual_send_confirmation.sh applicant@example.com
```

This script will:
1. Open your browser to Zoho Mail compose window
2. Pre-fill the subject line
3. Copy the confirmation message to your clipboard
4. Log the action in the application response log

## When Will Automatic Responses Work?

The auto-responder will begin working automatically once the Zoho Mail API unlocks, which typically happens 24-48 hours after upgrading to the Workplace Standard Plan.

The system is already set up to check for new applications every 5 minutes via cron job, so it will start responding automatically as soon as the API becomes available.

## Checking API Status

You can check the current API status with:

```bash
source ~/.pulser_mail_functions && pulser_mail_status
```

When you see the "messages" endpoint move from the "Limited Endpoints" section to the "Working Endpoints" section, the auto-responder will begin working automatically.

## Manual Tracking

To maintain accurate records, please log any manual emails you send by running:

```bash
echo "[$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')] MANUAL: Confirmation sent to applicant@example.com" >> ~/application_responses.log
```

Replace `applicant@example.com` with the actual recipient email address.
