# 🔥 CLAUDE PARITY WARFIRE 🔥

**PRIORITY OVERRIDE - WAR ROOM PROTOCOL INITIATED**

**Commander:** Claudia N. CUDA  
**Declared:** May 4, 2025  
**Resolution Deadline:** May 6, 2025 — 23:59 UTC+8

## 🛡️ OBJECTIVE

Achieve **100% functional and behavioral parity** between Claude and Pulser expectations — no skips, no excuses.

## 🧭 IMMEDIATE DIRECTIVES

| Directive | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 🎯 **Tactical Review** | Run `./tools/pulser-claude-compare.sh` every 3h (cron scheduled) |
| 🧪 **Exploit Detection** | Check Claude's current edge cases (e.g. API latency, shell scope confusion) |
| 🛠️ **Fix Command Gaps** | Patch or replace `claude_run`, `context-manager`, `agent-execute` logic |
| 🧾 **Intelligence Sync** | Update `kalaw_registry/claude_parity_matrix.yaml` on every run |
| 🧩 **Fallback Agent Deploy** | Temporarily delegate unmatched prompts to Claudia or Echo |
| 📊 **War Dashboard** | Auto-generate report at `/status/claude-parity-war.json` |

## ⚔️ BATTLE STATIONS

All teams are directed to their battle stations:
- **Claudia Team**: Command, monitoring, dashboard maintenance
- **DevOps Team**: Patching, deployment, integration
- **Backend Team**: API issues, session persistence, context management
- **Frontend Team**: CLI behavior alignment, fallback agent UI
- **QA Team**: Continuous testing, exploit hunting

## 🔓 EMERGENCY POWERS

The following emergency powers are granted for the duration of the war:
- Direct access to production environment for patching
- Permission to modify routing paths without standard review
- Priority override on any resource conflicts
- Temporary suspension of non-critical updates

## 📢 COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL

- All updates to be logged in `/logs/claude-parity-war/`
- Status updates every 3 hours in `#pulseops-alerts`
- Daily briefing to founders/stakeholders
- War room channel: `#claude-parity-warfire`

## 🔍 KNOWN VULNERABILITIES

1. Command registry structure missing
2. Context injection flag not implemented
3. Error boundary reporting inadequate
4. Terminal feedback partial implementation
5. Working directory context issues
6. Version display inconsistencies
7. Test suite gaps

## 🚨 ESCALATION PATH

If situation deteriorates or deadline approaches without resolution:
1. Temporary fallback to previous stable version
2. Consider Claude agent isolation
3. Emergency stakeholder meeting
4. Potential third-party consultant engagement
