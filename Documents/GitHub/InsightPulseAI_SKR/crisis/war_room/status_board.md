# RED2025 Crisis War Room Status Board
**Protocol:** Phase 2.5 Validation & Final Push
**Last Updated:** Sat May  3 11:37:30 PST 2025
**Deadline:** May 6, 2025 (72h from start)

## Current Metrics
| Metric | Baseline | Current | Target | Velocity | ETA |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|----------|-----|
| Cognitive Load | 4.7 → **2.5** | 2.1 | -0.3/day | 24h |
| 3G Success | 8% → **75%** | 95% | +10%/12h | 36h |
| Silent Fails | 22% → **9%** | <1% | -4%/6h | 12h |
| WCAG Issues | 34 → **9** | 0 | -3/8h | 24h |

**Projection**: All targets achievable within 48h if current velocity holds.
