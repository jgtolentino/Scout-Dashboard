## 2. Implementation Strategy

### Phase I: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Extract and refactor core components from crisis solutions
- Create production-ready implementation classes
- Develop configuration and monitoring interfaces
- Establish integration test framework

### Phase II: Integration (Weeks 3-4)
- Integrate with existing production codebase
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Create developer documentation and examples
- Conduct initial performance impact assessment

### Phase III: Validation (Weeks 5-6)
- Conduct comprehensive A/B testing
- Perform load and stress testing
- Complete security and privacy review
- Validate metrics against targets

### Phase IV: Deployment (Weeks 7-8)
- Roll out to 10% of production users
- Monitor and adjust based on telemetry
- Expand to 50% if metrics remain stable
- Complete full deployment with monitoring

## 3. Architectural Considerations

### Modularity
All optimizations must be implemented as modular, configurable components that can be:
- Enabled/disabled independently
- Configured at different thresholds
- Extended with custom behaviors
- Combined with existing systems

### Performance Impact
Performance considerations must be primary:
- Maximum 10ms impact on initial load time
- No more than 5% increase in memory usage
- Background operations for intensive calculations
- Lazy loading of non-critical components

### Compatibility
Solutions must maintain compatibility with:
- All supported browsers (IE11+, modern browsers)
- Mobile and desktop platforms
- Third-party integrations
- Existing accessibility solutions

### Scalability
Architecture must support scaling to:
- Full user base (10M+ users)
- Global deployment across all regions
- Diverse device capabilities
- Varying network conditions

## 4. Developer Experience

### Documentation
Comprehensive documentation including:
- Architectural overview
- Integration guides
- Configuration reference
- Best practices

### Tools
Developer tooling including:
- Debugging utilities
