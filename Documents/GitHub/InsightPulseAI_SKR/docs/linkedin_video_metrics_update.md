## Technical Implementation

### API Changes

LinkedIn's API responses will change to include:

- Legacy `view_based_vcr` field (temporary)

Update all API integrations with:

```python
# Before March 2025
vcr = response.get('view_based_vcr', 0)

# After March 2025
vcr = response.get('impression_based_vcr', 0)
```

### Dashboard Modifications

For all InsightPulseAI dashboards:

1. Update metric definitions
2. Add tooltips explaining the change
3. Include a visual indicator for pre/post change data

## Monitoring System

To ensure proper implementation:

- **Weekly Checks**: February - April 2025
- **Automated Alert**: If VCR drops by more than 35%
- **Validation Process**: Compare sample of 10 videos pre/post change
