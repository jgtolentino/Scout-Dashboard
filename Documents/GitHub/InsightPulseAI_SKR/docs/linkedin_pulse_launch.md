# LinkedIn Campaign Setup: Pulse Soft Launch

## Campaign Status Issue: "Not delivering - Payment method required"

This error indicates that your LinkedIn campaign cannot start delivering ads because a valid payment method is missing or has issues. Here's how to resolve it:

### Troubleshooting Steps

   - Log in to LinkedIn Campaign Manager
   - Go to your account settings in the top right
   - Select "Billing center"
   - Add a credit card or update existing payment information
   - Ensure the billing address matches the card details exactly

2. **Verify Payment Method Status**
   - Check if your card has expired
   - Ensure you haven't reached your credit limit
   - Confirm the card hasn't been flagged for fraud protection
   - Make sure your bank isn't blocking LinkedIn charges (common with international transactions)

3. **Confirm Billing Contact**
   - Ensure the billing contact email is correct
   - Check if any billing notifications went to spam

4. **Contact LinkedIn Support**
   - If issues persist, contact LinkedIn Ads support
   - Have your account ID and campaign details ready
