  Export the TBWA-styled diagram as PNG using one of these methods:
  1. Open with draw.io desktop application and export as PNG
  2. Use draw.io CLI if available: drawio -x -f png -o output.png input.drawio
  3. Use the draw.io web application (https://app.diagrams.net/) to open the file and export as PNG

  - Blocky layout style
  - Black vertical sidebar for Governance
  - Color legend
  - TBWA branding elements
