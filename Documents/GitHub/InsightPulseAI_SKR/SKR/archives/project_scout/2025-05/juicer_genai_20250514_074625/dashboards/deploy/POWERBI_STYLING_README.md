## File Structure

- `powerbi_style.css` - Contains all Power BI styling rules
- `insights_dashboard.html` - Main dashboard updated with new styling
- `images/` - Contains white-labeled icons and fallbacks

## Implementation Details

### Font Family

All text elements now use Microsoft's Segoe UI with appropriate fallbacks. Font weights have been adjusted to match Power BI conventions:
- 400 (Regular) for body text
- 600 (SemiBold) for headers and titles

### Color Palette

Following the Power BI style guide, we've implemented:
- Background: #F9F9F9
- Card borders: #E1E1E1
- Text colors: #252423 (primary), #605E5C (secondary)
- Accent colors: #0078D4 (links, buttons)

### Card Styling

The previous colored headers have been replaced with white headers that have a colored band on top, matching Power BI's visual card design patterns.

### Tag Cloud

Tags now follow the slicer chip design from Power BI with pill shapes and appropriate hover states.

### UI Components

- Dropdowns use the Fluent UI ChevronDown16 icon
- CTAs are now text links rather than button pills
- Footer has been redesigned to match client branding

## Usage Notes

1. To modify component colors, adjust the CSS variables in `:root`
2. All key metrics and chart formats are now compatible with Power BI design language
3. All styling is responsive and will adjust appropriately for smaller screens

## White-Labeling Changes

- "InsightPulseAI" → "Retail Advisor Analytics"
- "Juicer" → "Retail Advisor"
- All internal agent references removed (Claudia, Maya, etc.)
- LLM identifiers changed to "Analytics AI"
