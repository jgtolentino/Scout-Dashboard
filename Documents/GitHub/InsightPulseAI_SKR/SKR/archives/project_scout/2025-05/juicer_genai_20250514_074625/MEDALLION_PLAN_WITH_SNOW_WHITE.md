# Medallion Architecture Implementation Plan with Snow White Integration

This document outlines how to deploy the Azure Medallion Well-Architected Framework enhancements along with the Snow White white-labeling agent.

## 1. Architecture Enhancements

The following Medallion Architecture enhancements will be implemented:

### Compute Isolation (1_compute_isolation.sh)

- Creates dedicated Databricks clusters for each medallion layer:
  - BronzeLayerProcessing (2-4 workers, autoscaling)
  - SilverLayerProcessing (2-6 workers, autoscaling)
  - GoldPlatinumLayerProcessing (2-8 workers, autoscaling)
- Optimizes Spark configurations for each layer's specific workload
- Stores cluster IDs in Key Vault for reference

### Data Quality Framework (2_data_quality_framework.py)

- Implements Great Expectations for data validation
- Creates layer-specific validation notebooks in Databricks
- Adds data quality checks between medallion layers
- Updates Databricks jobs to include validation steps
- Stores quality metrics in dedicated tables

### Monitoring & Alerting (3_monitoring_alerting.sh)

- Creates Log Analytics workspace for centralized monitoring
- Configures diagnostic settings for all Azure resources
- Sets up alerting for critical metrics and failures
- Creates monitoring dashboards for operational visibility
- Configures email notifications for important events

### Storage Lifecycle Management (4_storage_lifecycle_management.sh)

- Implements tiered storage strategy with automatic transitions:
  - Bronze: Hot → Cool (30 days) → Archive (90 days)
  - Silver: Hot → Cool (60 days) → Archive (180 days)
  - Gold: Hot → Cool (90 days)
  - Platinum: 2-year retention policy
- Sets up daily blob inventory reporting
- Enables soft delete for data recovery
- Creates storage monitoring dashboard

### Security Enhancements (5_security_enhancements.sh)

- Creates Virtual Network with dedicated subnets
- Implements private endpoints for sensitive services
- Configures network security rules with default deny
- Sets up automated API key rotation via Azure Automation
- Enables audit logging for security monitoring

## 2. Snow White Integration

The Snow White white-labeling agent will be integrated into the architecture for client deliverables:

### Agent Setup

- YAML configuration (`snowwhite.yaml`) defines agent capabilities
- JavaScript implementation provides white-labeling functionality
- CLI interface enables command-line access to Snow White features
- Integration with existing agents for seamless operation

### White-Labeling Resources

- `alias_map.yaml` maps internal references to client-friendly terms
- License and notice files provide proper copyright information
- Directory structure matches client expectations

### White-Labeling Process with Medallion Architecture

1. Data flows through the medallion layers (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum)
2. At the Platinum layer, insights are generated for dashboards
3. Before client delivery, Snow White processes all outputs to:
   - Replace internal agent references with client-friendly terms
   - Strip proprietary metadata and implementation details
   - Apply appropriate licensing and notices
   - Ensure all terminology is consistent with client branding

## 3. Implementation Approach

To implement both the medallion architecture enhancements and Snow White integration:

1. Deploy medallion architecture enhancements first:
   ```bash
   cd medallion_enhancements
   ./6_deploy_medallion_enhancements.sh
   ```

2. Test the medallion architecture with sample data

3. Configure Snow White for white-labeling:
   ```bash
   # Customize alias mappings if needed
   node scripts/snowwhite_cli.js aliasmap edit --category agents --internal "Claudia" --client "TaskRunner"
   
   # Test white-labeling on a sample file
   node scripts/snowwhite_cli.js preview --file docs/ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md
   ```

4. Deploy client-facing artifacts with Snow White:
   ```bash
   node scripts/snowwhite_cli.js whitelabel --client "ProjectScout" --source ./dashboards --output ./client-facing/dashboards
   ```

5. Verify white-labeled outputs for compliance:
   ```bash
   node scripts/snowwhite_cli.js check --directory ./client-facing
   ```

## 4. Manual Enhancement Deployment

If the automated deployment script encounters issues, each enhancement can be deployed individually:

```bash
# 1. Compute Isolation
./1_compute_isolation.sh

# 2. Data Quality Framework
python3 2_data_quality_framework.py --workspace-url <databricks-url> [options]

# 3. Monitoring & Alerting
./3_monitoring_alerting.sh

# 4. Storage Lifecycle Management
./4_storage_lifecycle_management.sh

# 5. Security Enhancements
./5_security_enhancements.sh
```

## 5. Verification Steps

After deployment, verify the implementation:

1. Check Azure resources in the portal
2. Verify Databricks clusters and notebooks
3. Test data quality checks with sample data
4. Check monitoring dashboards and alerts
5. Verify storage lifecycle policies
6. Test security configurations
7. Validate white-labeling with Snow White

## 6. Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered:

1. For Azure resources, revert to previous configurations
2. For Databricks, restore from workspace backups
3. For white-labeling, maintain original files in source control

This combined approach ensures technical excellence through the medallion architecture while maintaining proper IP protection and client branding through the Snow White agent.
