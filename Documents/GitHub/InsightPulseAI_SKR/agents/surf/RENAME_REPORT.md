# Rename Report: Winsurf â†’ Surf

This file documents the renaming of the "Winsurf" agent to simply "Surf" throughout the codebase.

## Changes Made

1. Renamed directory from `/agents/winsurf/` to `/agents/surf/`
2. Updated all script references from "winsurf" to "surf"
3. Updated environment variable names from `WINSURF_*` to `SURF_*`
4. Updated class names and references in Python code
5. Updated all banner text and documentation

## Files Modified

- `/agents/surf/run.sh` (renamed from `/agents/winsurf/run.sh`)
- `/agents/surf/surf_agent.py` (renamed from `/agents/winsurf/winsurf_agent.py`)
- `/agents/surf/surf.yaml` (renamed from `/agents/winsurf/winsurf.yaml`)
- `/scripts/surf_command.sh`
- `/tools/js/router/commands/surf.js`
- `/README_SURF.md`
- System outputs and generated report files

## Purpose

This change simplifies the branding and makes the command easier to use (`:surf` instead of `:winsurf`).

## Verification

The functionality remains identical, only the naming has been changed. The agent continues to operate with the exact same capabilities and interface.
