# Apraoched Strategy Test

## Overview

This is a test markdown file for validating the routing of apraoched strategy documents.

## Key Components

1. File naming convention: `apraoched_*.md`
2. Automatic routing to `/00_APRAOCHED/` directory
3. Notification: `ðŸ§¿ Claudia updated strategy: filename â†’ synced to /00_APRAOCHED/`

## Expected Outcome

This file should be automatically detected and routed to the appropriate directory when Claudia runs.
