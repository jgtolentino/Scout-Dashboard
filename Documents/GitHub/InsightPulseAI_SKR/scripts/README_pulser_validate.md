# Pulser MVP Validation Script

This script validates the Pulser MVP against expected checkpoints to provide real-time status of the project.

## Features

- Validates core project structure (package.json, vite.config.js, main.js, public/, src/)
- Checks for required dependencies (electron, react, openai, vite, tailwindcss)
- Validates build scripts (dev, build, start/electron:serve)
- Confirms OpenAI integration
- Verifies Pulser branding has replaced Pointer references
- Tests local build (optional)
- Logs validation results to the Claudia sync log

## Usage

Run the script manually:
```bash
/Users/tbwa/Documents/GitHub/InsightPulseAI_SKR/scripts/pulser_validate.sh
```

Or use the alias (available after reloading your shell):
```bash
pulser-validate
```

## Quick Status Check

View the latest Pulser MVP status check:
```bash
pulser-status
```

## Integration with Claudia

This script integrates with Claudia's sync system by:
1. Logging validation results to `~/claudia_sync.log`
2. Providing quick status check through the `pulser-status` alias
3. Showing detailed validation output when run directly

## Extending the Script

To add more validation checks:
1. Add new validation steps to the script
2. Ensure proper logging to both console and log file
3. Update the final validation logic if needed

## Automated Validation

For automated daily validation, use the scheduling script:
```bash
/Users/tbwa/Documents/GitHub/InsightPulseAI_SKR/scripts/schedule_pulser_validation.sh
```

This will:
1. Add a cron job to run the validation script daily at 9 AM
2. Log results to both Claudia's sync log and a separate validation log
3. Enable continuous monitoring of the Pulser MVP's status
