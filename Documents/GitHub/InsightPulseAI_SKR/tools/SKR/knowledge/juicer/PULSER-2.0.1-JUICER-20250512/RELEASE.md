# Pulser 2.0.x Juicer Stack - Release Information

**Version:** 2.0.1  
**Release Date:** May 2025  
**Status:** Locked for Claudia's Orchestration Record  
**Author:** InsightPulseAI Team

## Overview

Juicer is a PowerBI-like AI + BI system embedded directly into the Pulser stack, providing seamless integration between data analysis, visualization, and AI-driven insights. This implementation has been officially locked as part of the Pulser 2.0.x release series.

## Architecture

The implementation leverages a modular architecture with:

- **Open-source visualization** using Chart.js + SVG embedding
- **Brand-aware SQL pipelines** via Databricks notebooks + Azure SQL
- **Sketch-based flow diagrams** using SVG sketch generator
- **Pulser CLI orchestration** with `:juicer` command + Claudia routing
- **Agentic enrichment** via Echo, Kalaw, and Sunnies

## Component Validation

| Component                              | Status | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `juicer_enrich_silver.py` (Databricks) | ✅      | Processes brands and sentiment into Silver layer with full medallion architecture |
| `juicer_dash_shell.html`               | ✅      | Fully functional BI shell with JSON-driven blocks + SVG sketch previews |
| `:juicer` CLI command                  | ✅      | Node.js + Python CLI works with both sketch generation and SQL pipelines |
| FastAPI + SQLAlchemy backend           | ✅      | Routed via Claudia and Maya with proper field mapping for entity extraction |
| Integration with Echo + Kalaw          | ✅      | RAG + entity recall works for natural language to SQL conversion |
| CLI install script (`install.sh`)      | ✅      | Prepares development environment and CLI symlinks for easy setup |
| Agent hooks (`juicer_hook.yaml`)       | ✅      | Claudia dispatch + Maya orchestration confirmed with proper routing |

## Installation

The installation is managed via the `install.sh` script which:

1. Installs all required dependencies
2. Sets up configuration files
3. Establishes CLI symlinks
4. Configures agent hooks

## Usage Examples

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Natural language query
:juicer query "Brand share for Jollibee vs McDo last 30 days"

# Execute notebook
:juicer notebook juicer_enrich_silver --params date=2025-05-01 env=prod

# View dashboard
:juicer dashboard agent_brand_heatmap
```

### Dashboard Embedding

```html
<iframe src="/dashboards/juicer_dash_shell.html" style="width:100%; height:800px;"></iframe>
```

### API Integration

```javascript
// Generate visualization from data
const result = await fetch('/api/command', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    command: 'juicer',
    args: {
      action: 'visualize',
      data: brandMentionData
    }
  })
});
```

## Integration Points

Juicer integrates with the following Pulser components:

- **Claudia** - Main orchestrator for routing queries and commands
- **Maya** - Handles visualization generation and dashboard rendering
- **Echo** - Provides speech-to-text processing and entity extraction
- **Kalaw** - Manages knowledge integration and metadata cataloging
- **Sunnies** - Renders visual elements and sketch diagrams

## Synced to Kalaw

This implementation has been indexed by Kalaw for long-term reference and can be retrieved via:

```bash
:kalaw recall juicer-stack specification
:kalaw lookup "pulser 2.0.x juicer"
```

## Future Roadmap

While this implementation is locked for the 2.0.x release, future enhancements planned for 2.1.x include:

1. Real-time dashboard updates via WebSockets
2. Enhanced natural language processing for complex analytical queries
3. Integration with Ressa for automated visual summary reports
4. Multi-tenant dashboard support with granular permissions
5. Expanded agent capabilities for autonomous data analysis
