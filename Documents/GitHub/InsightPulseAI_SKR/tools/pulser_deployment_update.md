# Pulser Deployment Update

## Overview

The Pulser deployment model has been updated. The old Electron-based GUI application has been archived and is no longer in active use. The system has shifted to a new deployment approach to better support LinkedIn ads system orchestration.

## Changes

1. **Archived Components:**
   - Electron GUI application
   - Local Vite development server
   - Client-side React components

2. **Current Deployment Model:**
   - Task-based CLI orchestration
   - Docket-driven workflow
   - Agent-based execution model
   - LinkedIn conversion implementation automation

## Migration Notes

All tasks and configurations from the previous Electron-based system have been migrated to the new deployment model. The LinkedIn ads system tasks and conversion implementations continue to function with the updated deployment approach.

## Using the Updated System

Instead of launching the GUI application, use the CLI commands to interact with Pulser:

```bash
# Verify docket structure
:verify-docket

# Execute tasks
:task "Start execution based on docket linkedin_ads_system_update"

# Enter operations mode
:pulseops
```

## Next Steps

The LinkedIn ads system implementation will continue as planned. All conversion tracking points remain valid, and the campaign deployment will proceed according to the defined schedule.

**Important:** Any references to the Electron GUI in documentation should be updated to reflect the current CLI-based workflow.
## GUI Decommissioning

The Electron GUI has been fully decommissioned as of Fri May  2 10:25:28 PST 2025. All Pulser functionality is now accessible through the CLI interface only.

The `pulser` command has been updated to always use CLI mode.
