# Pulser CLI Enhancement Update

The Pulser CLI has been enhanced with additional features to prevent model confusion and improve workflow efficiency.

## New Features

### 1. Structured Implementation Instructions Detection

The CLI now automatically detects when users enter structured implementation instructions and prevents them from being sent to the model. These instructions are logged internally for later use.

**Supported formats:**
- `✅ For Pulser — <instruction>`
- `## 🧠 For Pulser <instruction>`
- `## ✅ Fix: <instruction>`

When these patterns are detected, the instruction is logged to `~/.pulser_internal_tasks.log` and a confirmation message is shown instead of sending the text to the model.

### 2. Multi-line Input Box

A new `:input` command opens a multi-line input box for longer prompts or instructions:

```
pulser[🔵 prompt]> :input

📝 Multi-line Input Mode (Enter '---' on a line by itself to finish)

> This is line 1
> This is line 2
> This is line 3
> ---
```

This feature also automatically detects and logs structured implementation instructions.

### 3. Task Acceptance

The `:accept_task` command retrieves and displays the most recently logged implementation instruction:

```
pulser[🔵 prompt]> :accept_task

📋 Latest Task:

✅ For Pulser — Add automatic detection of implementation instructions

✅ Task loaded and ready for implementation.
```

## Integration with Environment Variable Detection

These new features complement the recently added environment variable detection, creating a more intelligent shell experience that avoids sending shell commands or implementation instructions to models by mistake.

## Usage

All new features are available in the latest version of the enhanced Pulser CLI. To use them:

```bash
# Run the enhanced Pulser shell
./pulser_shell_enhancement.py

# View all available commands
pulser[🔵 prompt]> :help

# Enter a multi-line implementation instruction
pulser[🔵 prompt]> :input

# View and apply the most recent instruction
pulser[🔵 prompt]> :accept_task
```
