# Scout Dashboard URL Structure Fix

## Problem Overview
The Scout Dashboard deployment was experiencing 404 errors due to inconsistent URL structure implementation in Azure Static Web Apps. The primary issue was the missing or improperly configured:

1. Directory structure for clean URLs (`/advisor`, `/edge`, `/ops`)
2. Flat HTML files for direct access (`advisor.html`, `edge.html`, `ops.html`)
3. Proper routing configuration in `staticwebapp.config.json`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Correct File Structure
We've implemented a dual-access file structure:

```
/
├── index.html               # Main entry point
├── advisor.html             # Flat file for direct access
├── edge.html                # Flat file for direct access
├── ops.html                 # Flat file for direct access
├── advisor/
│   └── index.html           # For clean URL access
├── edge/
│   └── index.html           # For clean URL access
└── ops/
    └── index.html           # For clean URL access
```

### 2. Proper staticwebapp.config.json
We've updated the configuration to handle both clean URLs and direct access:

```json
{
  "routes": [
    { 
      "route": "/advisor", 
      "rewrite": "/advisor/index.html" 
    },
    { 
      "route": "/edge", 
      "rewrite": "/edge/index.html" 
    },
    { 
      "route": "/ops", 
      "rewrite": "/ops/index.html" 
    },
    {
      "route": "/insights_dashboard.html",
      "redirect": "/advisor",
      "statusCode": 301
    },
    {
      "route": "/advisor.html", 
      "rewrite": "/advisor/index.html" 
    }
  ],
  "navigationFallback": {
    "rewrite": "/index.html",
    "exclude": ["/images/*.{png,jpg,gif}", "/css/*", "/js/*", "/assets/*"]
  }
}
```

### 3. Validation Tools
We've created a URL verification script (`dashboard_url_verification.sh`) that checks:
- Clean URLs accessibility
- Direct file accessibility
- Proper redirects for legacy URLs
- Asset loading

### 4. Documentation
We've created comprehensive documentation:
- `URL_STRUCTURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Guide for implementing proper URL structure
- `dashboard_url_verification.sh` - Tool for validating deployment

## Verification Results
All URLs now resolve properly:

| URL Pattern | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| `/advisor` | ✓ 200 | Clean URL access |
| `/advisor.html` | ✓ 200 | Direct file access |
| `/advisor/index.html` | ✓ 200 | Direct access to index file |
| `/edge` | ✓ 200 | Clean URL access |
| `/edge.html` | ✓ 200 | Direct file access |
| `/ops` | ✓ 200 | Clean URL access |
| `/ops.html` | ✓ 200 | Direct file access |
| `/insights_dashboard.html` | ✓ 301 | Properly redirects to `/advisor` |

## Next Steps
1. Apply this URL structure to all future dashboard deployments
2. Update CI/CD pipeline scripts to ensure proper file structure is maintained
3. Run the verification script after each deployment to catch potential issues
4. Update documentation to reflect this best practice for Azure Static Web Apps
