=== Manual Actions Required ===
The following actions should be performed manually:

1. Review access policies exported to the files in keyvault_security_20250519
   - Remove unnecessary access policies
   - Ensure least privilege principle is followed

2. For Key Vaults with unrestricted network access:
   - Identify which networks need access to the Key Vault
   - Update the Key Vault to allow only those networks
   - Example: az keyvault update --name <vault-name> --resource-group <resource-group> --default-action Deny --ip-address <allowed-ip>

3. Review Key Vault secrets and certificates:
   - Identify and remove any expired or unused secrets
   - Ensure all secrets have appropriate expiration dates
