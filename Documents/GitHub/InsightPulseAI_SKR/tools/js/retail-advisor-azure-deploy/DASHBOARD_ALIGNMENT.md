|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| CSS Variables               | Color palette, spacing, typography               | `css/shared-theme.css` |
| Card Design                 | Border-radius, shadows, hover effects            | `css/shared-theme.css` |
| Typography                  | Segoe UI font family, heading/body styles        | `css/shared-theme.css` |
| Dark Mode                   | Toggle + localStorage persistence                | All dashboards        |

| Data Visualization Style    | Chart colors, sizes, label formatting            | All dashboards        |

## ðŸ›  Maintaining Visual Consistency

To maintain visual consistency across all dashboards:

1. **Always make style changes in the shared CSS first:**
   ```bash
   # Edit the shared theme
   nano /css/shared-theme.css
   
   # Then run the application script to update all dashboards
   ./apply_retail_advisor_aesthetic.sh
   ```

2. **When adding new components to any dashboard:**
   - First check if the component exists in Retail Advisor
   - If yes, reuse the exact same styling
   - If no, create the component following the same design language

3. **When updating Retail Advisor:**
   - After updating the Retail Advisor design
   - Re-run the `apply_retail_advisor_aesthetic.sh` script to sync styles

## ðŸ”„ Cross-Dashboard Navigation

All dashboards include navigation links to the other dashboards, ensuring a seamless user experience:

- **Retail Advisor** â†’ links to Retail Edge and System QA
- **Retail Edge** â†’ links to Retail Advisor and System QA
- **System QA** â†’ links to Retail Advisor and Retail Edge
