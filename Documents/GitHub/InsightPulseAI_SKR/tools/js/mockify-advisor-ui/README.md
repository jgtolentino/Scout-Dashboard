### Pricing Reference (per 1K tokens)

| Model | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| GPT-4.1 | $2.00 | $8.00 |
| GPT-4.1 nano | $0.10 | $0.40 |
| GPT-4o mini | $0.15 | $0.60 |
| GPT-3.5 Turbo | $0.50 | $1.50 |
| o-series (reasoning) | $1.10 | $60.00 |

**Token Math Example**:
```
[(Input tokens Ã— rate) + (Output tokens Ã— rate)] Ã· 1,000
```

Example: 200 input + 900 output with GPT-4o mini = (200 Ã— $0.15 + 900 Ã— $0.60) Ã· 1000 = $0.59
