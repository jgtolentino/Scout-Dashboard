# SOP Registry Implementation Note

The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) registry has been successfully registered with the Pulser system on May 18, 2025.

## Registry Overview

This implementation connects the InsightPulseAI SOP profiles with the Pulser system, enabling consistent deployment procedures across all applications. The registry contains two primary SOP profiles:

1. **Standard SOP Profile (v1.0)**
   - Basic deployment structure for all applications
   - QA verification steps
   - Monitoring and maintenance routines

2. **Data Toggle SOP Profile (v1.1)**
   - Enhanced profile with data source toggle functionality
   - Medallion architecture layer integration
   - Support for switching between real and simulated data

## Implementation Details

The registration script (`register_sop_registry.js`) performs the following actions:

1. Verifies existence of required profile YAML files
2. Registers both profiles with the Pulser system
3. Generates implementation templates for example applications
4. Updates Pulser task routing configuration
5. Creates SKR archive entry for documentation

Implementation templates have been generated for the following applications:
- PRISMA (Analysis Platform)
- GEZ (AI Engine)
- PulseUP (Dashboard)
- RetailEdge (Retail Dashboard)

## Usage Instructions

To use the SOP registry with a new application:

```bash
# For basic SOP implementation
pulser init sop --profile pulser_sop_profile.yaml --app APP_NAME

# For data toggle SOP implementation
pulser init sop --profile pulser_sop_profile_with_toggle.yaml --app APP_NAME

# Validate SOP compliance
pulser validate sop --app APP_NAME

# Register with Pulser system
pulser register sop --app APP_NAME
```

## Files and Locations

- SOP Profiles:
  - `./final-locked-dashboard/pulser_sop_profile.yaml`
  - `./final-locked-dashboard/pulser_sop_profile_with_toggle.yaml`
  
- Generated Templates and Documentation:
  - `./output/sop-registry/`
  
- Registration Scripts:
  - `./register_sop_registry.js`
  - `./register_sop_with_pulser.sh`

## Next Steps

1. Add the task routing configuration to your main Pulser config
2. Update application documentation to reference the SOP registry
3. Apply the SOP to all new application deployments
4. Validate existing applications against SOP requirements
