# MCP Integration Summary

## ‚úÖ Successful Integration Setup

The MCP integration between Claude and your local environment has been successfully configured. This integration enables Claude to access local resources through a secure, authenticated server connection.

## üîß Components Implemented

1. **Protocol-Compliant MCP Server**
   - Running on port 9315
   - Fully implements required MCP protocol endpoints
   - Supports both header-based and query parameter authentication
   - Includes proper CORS headers for browser connections

2. **CORS Proxy**
   - Running on port 8010
   - Allows browser-based Claude to connect to local services
   - Bypasses browser security restrictions

3. **Authentication System**
   - Using token: `mock-token-1234`
   - Secures all non-health endpoints
   - Properly validates Bearer token format

## üåê Connection Methods Verified

| Method | URL | Authentication | Status |
|--------|-----|----------------|--------|
| Direct Connection | http://127.0.0.1:9315 | Bearer token | ‚úÖ Working |
| Health Endpoint | http://127.0.0.1:9315/health | None needed | ‚úÖ Working |
| Status Endpoint | http://127.0.0.1:9315/status | Bearer token | ‚úÖ Working |
| CORS Proxy | http://localhost:8010/proxy | Bearer token | ‚úÖ Working |

   - Automatically installs dependencies
   - Tests all endpoints after startup

2. **mcp-protocol-compliant.js**
   - Full Node.js implementation of MCP protocol
   - Extensible for custom capabilities
   - Comprehensive logging and error handling

## üîê Security Measures

1. **Token-based authentication** for all endpoints (except health check)
2. **Configurable access controls** for file and command operations
3. **Detailed logging** of all access attempts
4. **CORS configuration** to limit cross-origin requests

## üß© Next Steps

1. **Custom Capabilities**
   - Add domain-specific tools to the MCP server
   - Register new capabilities in the `/capabilities` endpoint
   - Test with Claude to verify functionality

2. **Permanent Setup**
   - Configure the MCP server to start on system boot
   - Set up secure tunneling for remote access
   - Create backup of configuration

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test more complex workflows
   - Verify error handling
   - Monitor performance and stability
