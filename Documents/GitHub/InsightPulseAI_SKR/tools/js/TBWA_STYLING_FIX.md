# TBWA Dashboard Styling Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix the TBWA styling on the Client360 Dashboard.

## Issue

The TBWA branding colors were inconsistently applied across the dashboard, with:
- Website showing a blue/purple/pink/green color scheme 
- Code snippets defining TBWA colors as navy (#002B80), cyan (#00C3EC), red (#E60028), green (#00A551), and grey (#4B4F56)
- Dashboard theme implementation using yellow (#ffc300) and blue (#005bbb)

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated TBWA Theme Variables

Updated `variables-tbwa.scss` to use the correct TBWA brand colors:
- Primary: Navy (#002B80)
- Secondary: Cyan (#00C3EC)
- Success: Green (#00A551)
- Danger: Red (#E60028)
- Dark: Grey (#4B4F56)

### 2. Enhanced TBWA Theme Styling

Updated `tbwa.scss` to properly apply the branding:
- Changed header to navy background with cyan accents
- Updated element styling to use cyan for secondary elements
- Fixed contrasting colors for buttons and indicators
- Ensured all components consistently use the brand colors

### 3. Improved Deployment Process

Enhanced `deploy_tbwa_theme.sh` to ensure reliable theme deployment:
- Added forced rebuild with clean dist directory
- Added additional CSS file copies for redundancy
- Improved HTML template modification with branding class
- Added verification step to ensure theme files are included

### 4. Added Verification Tools

Added TBWA theme verification to the golden baseline tools:
- Enhanced `create-golden-baseline.sh` to capture theme information
- Updated `verify-against-golden.sh` to verify TBWA brand colors
- Added checks for critical theme files

## Testing

To test these changes:
1. Run `./scripts/deploy_tbwa_theme.sh` to build and deploy the TBWA theme
2. Run `./final-locked-dashboard/scout_dlt_pipeline/client360_dashboard/deploy_to_azure.sh` to deploy to Azure
3. Visit the deployed site to verify the TBWA styling is applied correctly

## Golden Baseline

Create a new golden baseline with the fixed TBWA styling:
```bash
./scripts/create-golden-baseline.sh --prefix tbwa-fixed -m "Fixed TBWA styling with official brand colors"
```

This will create a golden baseline that can be used for verification and rollback if needed.
