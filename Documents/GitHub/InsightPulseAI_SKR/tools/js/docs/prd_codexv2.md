# Product Requirements Document: Codex v2

**Product Name:** Codex v2  
**Owner:** OpenAI  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Release Date:** May 22, 2025  
**Status:** Draft  

## 1. Product Overview

Codex v2 is OpenAI's next-generation autonomous software engineering agent. Relaunched after acquiring Windsurf (Codeium) for $3B, it combines OpenAI's o3 LLM technology with Windsurf's developer-centric features and execution sandbox to deliver end-to-end feature development, test-writing, and PR automation in a cloud-isolated environment.

## 2. Product Objective

To become the industry-standard autonomous software engineering agent by combining OpenAI's LLMs (o3) with Windsurf's developer UX, offering end-to-end feature development, test-writing, and PR automation in a cloud-isolated environment.

## 3. Strategic Improvements over Previous Codex

| Area | Original Codex | Codex Relaunch |
| ---- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Core Function | Code completion | Autonomous agent for software development |
| UX | VSCode plug-in (basic autocomplete) | Cloud IDE with full agent execution sandbox |
| Backend | GPT-3.5–like Codex model | o3 model with parallel task orchestration |
| Task Handling | Single task (code assist) | Multi-tasking (feature write, test, PR, debug) |
| Acquisition Lift | N/A | Inherited Windsurf's Cascade + Supercomplete |

## 4. Key Features

* **Parallel Agent Execution:** Write code, debug, test, and PR—all handled simultaneously in cloud.
* **Cascade System (via Windsurf):** Agent router with specialized flows for frontend, backend, and infra.
* **Supercomplete:** Context-aware code generation across entire repo, not just local files.
* **Pull Request Autonomy:** Codex proposes changes and raises PRs with explanations.
* **Team Support:** Designed for solo devs, teams, and enterprise with role-based workflows.

## 5. UI/UX Design

* **One-Click "Try Codex" Button:** Immediate project boot in cloud IDE.
* **Taskboard View:** Kanban-like panel for seeing what Codex is executing.
* **Inline Explanation Pane:** Side panel with LLM reasoning + logs.
* **Safe Mode Execution:** Cloud-isolated, no local file modification without confirmation.

## 6. Functional Specifications

### 6.1 API Contracts

The Codex v2 API provides the following endpoints:

```
POST /v2/codex/implement
POST /v2/codex/refactor
POST /v2/codex/write-tests
POST /v2/codex/debug
POST /v2/codex/propose-pr
GET  /v2/codex/logs/stream
```

Each endpoint accepts standardized parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `repository_url` | string | URL of the git repository |
| `branch` | string | Branch to work on (defaults to "main") |
| `task_description` | string | Natural language task description |
| `file_paths` | array | Specific files to modify (optional) |
| `max_tokens` | integer | Maximum tokens to use (default: 4096) |
| `token_budget` | integer | Maximum token budget for the task |

### 6.2 CLI Commands

The CLI interface provides commands that match the API endpoints:

```bash
codex implement --repo <url> --task "Description" [--branch <branch>]
codex refactor --repo <url> --file <path> [--branch <branch>]
codex write-tests --repo <url> [--coverage <percentage>]
