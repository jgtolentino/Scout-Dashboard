# Pulser Client 2.2.0 Release

## Summary

This release introduces a new Prompt Engineering command that enhances Pulser's ability to work with and optimize prompts. The tools leverage the previously integrated system prompts collection to provide prompt analysis, improvement, and variation generation capabilities.

## New Features

### 1. Prompt Engineering Command (`prompt_engineer`)

The new `prompt_engineer` command provides three main functionalities:

- **Analyze:** Evaluate prompts for strengths, weaknesses, and improvement opportunities
- **Improve:** Enhance prompts based on specific goals (clarity, examples, specificity)
- **Variations:** Generate multiple variations of a prompt for A/B testing

```bash
# Analyze a prompt
pulser prompt_engineer analyze --prompt "Write a blog post about AI"

# Improve a prompt with specific goals
pulser prompt_engineer improve --prompt "Write code" --goals clarity,examples,specificity

# Generate prompt variations for A/B testing
pulser prompt_engineer variations --prompt "Explain quantum computing" --count 5
```

### 2. API Endpoints

Added three new API endpoints for integrating prompt engineering capabilities into web interfaces:

- `POST /api/prompt_engineer/analyze` - Analyze a prompt
- `POST /api/prompt_engineer/improve` - Improve a prompt based on goals
- `POST /api/prompt_engineer/variations` - Generate prompt variations

### 3. Command Registry

Created the command registry module (`command_registry.js`) to centralize command registration.

## Documentation

- Added prompt engineering section to the main README.md
- Created detailed PROMPT_ENGINEERING.md documentation with examples and best practices

## Technical Details

### New Files

- `/tools/js/utils/prompt-engineer.js` - Prompt engineering utility functions
- `/tools/js/router/commands/prompt_engineer.js` - CLI command implementation
- `/tools/js/router/command_registry.js` - Centralized command registry
- `/tools/js/PROMPT_ENGINEERING.md` - Detailed documentation

### Modified Files

- `/tools/js/router/api/index.js` - Added API endpoints
- `/tools/js/README.md` - Updated with prompt engineering information
- `/tools/js/package.json` - Updated version to 2.2.0

## Future Enhancements

- Prompt effectiveness scoring based on response quality
- Collaborative prompt improvement workflows

## Getting Started

To use the new prompt engineering features:

1. Update to version 2.2.0:
   ```bash
   npm update
   ```

2. Ensure you have the system prompts collection indexed:
   ```bash
   pulser system_prompts clone
   pulser system_prompts index
   ```

3. Try the prompt engineering commands:
   ```bash
   pulser prompt_engineer --help
   ```

See the PROMPT_ENGINEERING.md document for detailed usage instructions and examples.
