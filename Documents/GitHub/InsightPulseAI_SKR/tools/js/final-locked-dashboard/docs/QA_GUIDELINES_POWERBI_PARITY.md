# Power BI Parity QA Guidelines

This document outlines the quality assurance guidelines for maintaining parity between the Scout Advanced Analytics dashboard and the Power BI aesthetic found in the Vercel deployment.

## Overview

The Scout Advanced Analytics dashboard (`insights_dashboard_v2.html`) has been styled to match the polished Power BI-like experience of the Vercel deployment (`scoutadvisor.vercel.app`). This document provides guidelines for QA testing to ensure visual and functional parity is maintained.

## Deployment Verification

When deploying, the [SOP for Scout Dashboard Deployment](./SOP_DEPLOYMENT.md) should be followed to ensure proper deployment and verification. The deployment process includes several validation steps to verify that all necessary files are present and correctly configured.

### Deployment Options

1. **Using Make Commands (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   make package
   make deploy
   ```

2. **Manual Deployment**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy_dashboard.sh
   ```

3. **Dry Run Testing**
   ```bash
   make deploy-dry-run
   ```

## Visual Regression Testing

For automated visual regression testing:

1. Capture baseline screenshots after verified deployments
2. Compare new deployments against these baselines
3. Review any visual differences before approving

## Version Control

Every deployment should be tagged with a version following the pattern:
`powerbi-style-v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}`

Examples:
- `powerbi-style-v1.0.0` - Initial Power BI styled version
- `powerbi-style-v1.1.0` - Feature additions
- `powerbi-style-v1.0.1` - Bug fixes
