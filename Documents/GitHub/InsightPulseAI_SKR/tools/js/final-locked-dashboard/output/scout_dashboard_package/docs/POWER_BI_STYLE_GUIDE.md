# Power BI Style Harmonization Guide

This document explains the style harmonization changes implemented to align the Scout Advanced Analytics dashboard with the polished Power BI aesthetic from the Vercel deployment.

## Overview

The style harmonization aims to update the Azure-hosted `insights_dashboard.html` to match the visual design of `scoutadvisor.vercel.app`. Key goals are:

1. Implement a more modern, professional UI that follows Power BI design patterns
2. Unify the GenAI presentation to remove model-specific indicators
3. Create a responsive, accessible dashboard experience
4. Maintain all existing functionality while enhancing the visual aesthetics

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Navigation and Header

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Background color | Dark gray (#2E2F33) | Azure blue (#0078D4) |
| Layout | Simple title with buttons | Breadcrumb navigation with centered elements |
| Buttons | Basic styles | Refined with hover states and proper spacing |
| Branding | Basic | Enhanced TBWA branding with logo |

The header now uses a clean blue background with white text, proper breadcrumb navigation, and refined buttons that better match the Power BI aesthetic.

### 2. KPI Summary Cards

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Card style | Flat white boxes | Cards with left accent borders by category |
| Typography | Basic sizing | Enhanced with larger metrics, subtle labels |
| Layout | Tight grid | Better spacing with responsive grid system |
| Interactivity | Basic hover | Enhanced hover effects with subtle transitions |

KPI cards now feature category-specific left color accents, improved typography hierarchy, and better spacing. Metrics are more prominent with improved visual hierarchy.

### 3. Charts and Visualizations

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Chart containers | Basic white boxes | Enhanced containers with proper headers and footers |
| Legend positioning | Inconsistent | Standardized positioning (top or right) |
| Color schemes | Default Chart.js | Curated Azure-themed color palette |
| Axis labels | Basic | Enhanced with proper formatting for currency/numbers |

Charts now have consistent styling with proper headers, footers with data source attribution, and use a coordinated color palette that matches the Azure/TBWA branding.

### 4. GenAI Insights Section

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Card layout | List view | Responsive grid (1-3 columns based on screen size) |
| GenAI indicators | Model-specific | Unified "GenAI Enhanced" badges |
| Confidence visualization | Text only | Enhanced visual indicators |
| Tag styling | Basic | Button-like with rounded corners and category colors |

The GenAI insights have been transformed into a more visually appealing grid layout with unified styling. Model-specific indicators have been replaced with a consistent "Unified GenAI" approach.

### 5. Footer and Additional Elements

| Element | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Footer styling | Minimal | Enhanced with proper spacing and border |
| Last updated text | Basic | Styled with subtle text and timestamp |
| Overall spacing | Inconsistent | Standardized spacing throughout |

The footer now has a clean, subtle design with proper spacing and informational elements.

## CSS Structure

The harmonization uses a layered CSS approach:

1. **Base styles** - From the existing stylesheet
2. **retail_edge_style_patch.css** - Contains all Power BI style enhancements
3. **unified-genai.css** - Specific styling for the unified GenAI presentation

## Usage Instructions

### Local Testing

To test the harmonized dashboard locally:

1. Open `insights_dashboard_v2.html` in your browser
2. Verify all components render correctly
3. Test responsiveness by resizing the browser window

### Deployment

To deploy the Power BI styled dashboard to Azure:

```bash
cd /Users/tbwa/Documents/GitHub/InsightPulseAI_SKR/tools/js/final-locked-dashboard
./deploy_power_bi_styled.sh
```

This script will:
1. Package all necessary files
2. Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps
3. Provide a summary of the deployment with URLs
