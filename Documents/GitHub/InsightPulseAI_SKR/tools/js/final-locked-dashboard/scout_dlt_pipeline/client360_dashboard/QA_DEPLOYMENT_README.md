# Quality Assurance and Deployment Documentation

This README provides an overview of the robust quality assurance and deployment processes implemented for the Client360 Dashboard.

## Overview

To ensure successful deployments and maintain high-quality code, we've implemented several mechanisms:

1. **Automated Verification Scripts**
2. **Standardized Templates**
3. **Deployment SOP**
4. **QA Requirements in PRDs**

## Verification Script

The `scripts/verify_deployment.sh` script performs automated checks before deployment:

- TBWA theme file verification
- Rollback component style validation
- Logo resource verification
- CSS build verification
- Azure credential validation
- Deploy directory structure validation

### Usage

```bash
# Run verification before deployment
./scripts/verify_deployment.sh

# Deploy with integrated verification
./deploy_to_azure.sh
```

## Templates

### PRD Template

The Product Requirements Document (PRD) template includes a dedicated "Quality Assurance Requirements" section that requires:

- Specific verification checks to add
- Manual testing requirements
- Theme testing specifications
- Deployment verification steps
- Performance requirements

Location: `templates/PRD_TEMPLATE.md`

### Implementation Plan Template

The Implementation Plan template includes detailed sections on:

- Verification script updates
- Test scenarios
- Theme testing procedures
- Pre-deployment checklist
- Post-deployment verification

Location: `templates/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md`

## Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

The Deployment SOP mandates verification steps before, during, and after deployment:

- Pre-deployment verification MUST be run
- Deployment MUST NOT proceed if verification fails
- Theme-specific checks for TBWA-themed deployments
- Post-deployment verification

Location: `DEPLOYMENT_SOP.md`

## TBWA Theme Implementation

For TBWA theme specific details, refer to:

- `TBWA_THEME_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Overview of theme implementation
- `src/styles/variables-tbwa.scss` - TBWA brand color variables
- `src/themes/tbwa.scss` - TBWA theme styles and rollback component

## Workflow

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Use the PRD template to define QA requirements
   - Identify verification checks needed

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Use the Implementation Plan template
   - Add verification checks to the script
   - Update theme files as needed

3. **Deployment Phase**
   - Follow the Deployment SOP
   - Run verification before deployment
   - Document any issues

4. **Post-Deployment Phase**
   - Verify the deployment
   - Update documentation
   - Review for improvements

## Best Practices

- Always run verification before deployment
- Keep verification scripts updated with new checks
- Document deployment issues and solutions
- Review and improve the process after each deployment
