# Rollback UAT Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) framework for the Client360 Dashboard rollback feature. The implementation provides a comprehensive approach to verifying dashboard rollbacks while ensuring TBWA branding consistency and proper functionality.

## Components Implemented

| Component | Description | Path |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| UAT Template | Defines criteria for rollback UAT | `/templates/ROLLBACK_UAT_TEMPLATE.md` |
| UAT Generator Script | Creates UAT checklists from golden tags | `/scripts/generate_rollback_uat.sh` |
| Theme Verification Script | Verifies TBWA theme consistency | `/scripts/verify_tbwa_theme.sh` |
| UAT Process Guide | Documentation for the rollback UAT process | `/ROLLBACK_UAT_GUIDE.md` |

## Implementation Details

### 1. Rollback UAT Template

The template (`ROLLBACK_UAT_TEMPLATE.md`) provides a structured format for verifying rollbacks with sections for:

- Rollback information and environment details
- Functionality, UI/UX, and performance requirements
- Detailed test scenarios for rollback verification
- TBWA theme consistency validation
- Post-rollback dashboard verification
- Issue documentation and sign-off process

### 2. UAT Checklist Generator

The generator script (`generate_rollback_uat.sh`):

- Takes a golden tag as input and generates a customized UAT checklist
- Extracts information from the golden tag including commit hash, date, and author
- Verifies the existence of TBWA theme files and rollback component styles
- Creates a pre-populated UAT checklist with relevant verification items
- Adds rollback-specific notes and verification steps

### 3. TBWA Theme Verification

The theme verification script (`verify_tbwa_theme.sh`):

- Thoroughly checks CSS files for TBWA brand colors (Navy #002B80, Cyan #00C3EC)
- Verifies rollback component styles are properly included
- Checks for TBWA logo files and references in CSS
- Validates HTML files contain appropriate TBWA branding classes
- Confirms geospatial map component availability
- Generates a detailed verification report with pass/fail status
- Creates a practical post-rollback UAT checklist

### 4. UAT Process Documentation

The guide (`ROLLBACK_UAT_GUIDE.md`) provides:

- A step-by-step workflow for the rollback UAT process
- Instructions for using the implemented scripts
- Detailed procedures for preparation, execution, verification, and sign-off
- Acceptance criteria for rollback approval
- Roles and responsibilities for UAT participants
- Troubleshooting guidance for common rollback issues
- Post-rollback verification procedures

## Usage Flow

The components work together in the following flow:

1. **Identify Golden Tag**: Determine which known good version to roll back to
2. **Generate UAT Checklist**: Use `generate_rollback_uat.sh` to create a custom checklist
3. **Perform Rollback**: Execute the rollback using existing rollback scripts
4. **Verify Theme**: Run `verify_tbwa_theme.sh` to confirm TBWA branding consistency
5. **Complete UAT**: Go through the generated checklist, testing all aspects
6. **Document & Sign-off**: Record results, issues, and get stakeholder approval

## Integration with Existing System

This UAT framework integrates with the existing codebase by:

- Leveraging git tag information to identify golden baselines
- Working with existing rollback scripts for deployment
- Complementing the existing TBWA theme deployment process
- Following the established UAT framework structure

## Benefits

The implementation provides these key benefits:

1. **Standardized Verification**: Ensures consistent testing of all rollbacks
2. **Automated Preparation**: Reduces manual effort in creating UAT documents
3. **Theme Consistency**: Specifically validates the critical TBWA branding
4. **Documented Process**: Provides clear guidance for all UAT participants
5. **Faster Testing**: Streamlines the verification process with automated checks

## Conclusion

The rollback UAT implementation creates a robust framework for verifying dashboard rollbacks. It ensures that when critical issues occur, the system can be safely restored to a known good state while maintaining brand consistency and functionality. This implementation supports the Client360 Dashboard's high availability and reliability requirements.
