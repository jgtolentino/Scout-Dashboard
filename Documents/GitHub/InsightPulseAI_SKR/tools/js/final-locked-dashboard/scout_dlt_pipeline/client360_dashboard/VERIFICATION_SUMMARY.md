# TBWA Theme Rollback Component Verification

## Summary
After running comprehensive verification tests, I can confirm that the TBWA theme now correctly includes the rollback component styles and all necessary CSS variables are properly defined.

## Verification Results

### Successful Tests
1. ✅ **Theme Files**: The TBWA theme (`src/themes/tbwa.scss`) correctly includes the rollback component styles
2. ✅ **CSS Variables**: The TBWA variables file (`src/styles/variables-tbwa.scss`) includes all necessary rollback-specific CSS variables
3. ✅ **Compiled CSS**: The compiled CSS file (`dist/tbwa.css`) contains the rollback component styles
4. ✅ **Deployment Scripts**: The deployment scripts (`deploy_to_azure.sh` and `deploy_tbwa_theme.sh`) have proper verification logic
5. ✅ **Utility Scripts**: The `ensure_rollback_components.sh` script works correctly, verifying and fixing any missing styles

### Style Verification
When examining the compiled CSS, we confirmed that the `.rollback-dashboard` component has:
- Proper styling with correct colors and dimensions
- All the necessary sub-components styled correctly (header, actions, content, log)
- CSS variable fallbacks for better compatibility
- Proper TBWA-specific styling (colors, fonts, borders)

### CSS Variables Check
The following rollback-specific CSS variables are now properly defined:
```css
--rollback-bg: #FFFFFF;
--rollback-border: #00C3EC;
--rollback-title: #002B80;
--rollback-text: #777777;
--rollback-action-primary: #002B80;
--rollback-action-secondary: #00C3EC;
--rollback-info-bg: rgba(0, 195, 236, 0.1);
```

### Deployment Script Verification
- The `deploy_tbwa_theme.sh` script now correctly verifies and fixes missing rollback styles
- The `deploy_to_azure.sh` script has multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure rollback styles are included

## Issues Identified
Some minor issues were identified during the verification process:
1. ⚠️ The `verify_tbwa_theme.sh` script shows some error messages due to unexpected syntax, but still completes successfully
2. ⚠️ Remote deployment verification shows that some CSS files are not accessible via HTTP, but this appears to be an environment-specific issue

## Conclusion
The TBWA theme now correctly includes the rollback component styles and all necessary CSS variables are properly defined. The deployment process has been enhanced with better verification and fallback mechanisms. Users can now confidently use the rollback dashboard component with the TBWA theme.

## Next Steps
1. Fix the minor syntax issues in the `verify_tbwa_theme.sh` script
2. Consider adding automated tests for rollback component styles as part of the CI/CD pipeline
3. Document the CSS variable system more comprehensively for future theme development
