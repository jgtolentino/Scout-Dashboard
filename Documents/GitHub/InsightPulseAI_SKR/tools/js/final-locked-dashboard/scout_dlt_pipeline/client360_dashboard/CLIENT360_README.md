## üì¶ Installation

### For Azure Deployment

See [DIFF_AWARE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DIFF_AWARE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

### For Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure Azure OpenAI credentials in `.env.local`
4. Start local server: `npm run start`

## üîê Security Considerations

- **API Key Protection**: Azure OpenAI keys are stored in Azure Key Vault
- **Data Privacy**: All AI prompts are sanitized to remove PII
- **Access Control**: Role-based dashboard permissions
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS enforced for all traffic
- **Audit Logging**: Data access and toggle actions are logged

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| AI Insights panel shows "Loading" indefinitely | Check Azure OpenAI connectivity, toggle to Simulation mode as fallback |
| Map doesn't display | Verify internet connection, check browser console for MapBox errors |
| Filters have no effect | Clear browser cache, check for JavaScript errors in console |
| Exported data is incomplete | Check export parameters, verify data source connectivity |
