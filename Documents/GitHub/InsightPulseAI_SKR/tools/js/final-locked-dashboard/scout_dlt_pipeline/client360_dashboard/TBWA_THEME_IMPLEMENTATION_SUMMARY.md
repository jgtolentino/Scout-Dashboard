## Rollback Component Implementation

The rollback dashboard component required special attention to ensure it works properly within the TBWA theme. We implemented:

1. Explicit color variables for the component to ensure theme consistency
2. Proper styling of buttons, headers, and content sections using TBWA colors
3. Visual enhancements like borders, shadows, and spacing consistent with TBWA design language
4. Fallback mechanisms in deployment scripts to ensure the component is always properly styled

## Deployment Process

The deployment scripts were enhanced to:

1. Verify that theme files are properly included in deployment packages
2. Check that rollback component styles are present and correct
3. Implement fallback solutions if any issues are detected
4. Include comprehensive logging for deployment troubleshooting

## Testing

The theme implementation was tested across various scenarios:

1. **Visual Verification**: All components use correct TBWA brand colors
2. **Functional Testing**: Rollback component works correctly with the theme
3. **Deployment Testing**: Theme files are correctly included in deployment packages
4. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Verified in major browsers

## Future Recommendations

For future theme updates:

1. Consider implementing a more structured theme management system
2. Create a theme documentation page with color swatches for reference
3. Implement automatic validation of CSS variables against brand guidelines
4. Add theme unit tests for critical components like the rollback dashboard
