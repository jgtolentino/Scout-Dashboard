# Client360 Dashboard Deployment to /360 Path Summary

## Overview
The Client360 Dashboard has been successfully deployed to the `/360` path on Azure. This deployment ensures that all dashboard components are now accessible exclusively through the `/360` path, while the root path now serves as a landing page with links to the dashboard.

## Deployment Details
- **Deployment Time:** May 21, 2025
- **Azure Resource Group:** scout-dashboard
- **Application Name:** tbwa-client360-dashboard-production
- **Dashboard URL:** https://blue-coast-0acb6880f.6.azurestaticapps.net/360/
- **Landing Page URL:** https://blue-coast-0acb6880f.6.azurestaticapps.net/

## Changes Implemented

### Routing Configuration
- Updated `staticwebapp.config.json` to route `/360` and `/360/*` paths to the dashboard
- Set the root path (`/`) to display a landing page with links to the dashboard
- Configured proper URL fallbacks and error handling

### Path Handling
- Added `<base href="/360/">` tag to all dashboard HTML files
- Updated all asset references (CSS, JS, images) to use relative paths
- Ensured all internal links work correctly with the new URL structure

### Theme and Style Verification
- Verified that the TBWA theme includes all necessary rollback component styles
- Added explicit CSS variables for rollback components
- Ensured consistent styling across all components

### Landing Page
- Created a user-friendly landing page at the root URL
- Added direct links to the dashboard at `/360`
- Provided documentation links and system requirements
- Applied consistent TBWA branding (navy blue & cyan)

## Testing and Verification
- Verified rollback component styling works correctly
- Confirmed all asset files are loading properly from the `/360` path
- Tested navigation between landing page and dashboard
- Ensured TBWA theme is correctly applied

## Benefits of New URL Structure
1. **Improved Organization:** Keeps dashboard content under a dedicated path
2. **Better URL Management:** Creates a clear distinction between landing page and application
3. **Future Expansion:** Allows for adding other applications under different paths
4. **Enhanced Security:** Provides path-based routing for potential future access controls

## Next Steps
1. Update internal documentation to reference the new `/360` path
2. Add analytics tracking to monitor usage
3. Consider adding redirects from commonly accessed old URLs
4. Update any internal links or bookmarks pointing to the dashboard

## Technical Note
The implementation uses Azure Static Web App's routing capabilities to serve different content based on the URL path. The base tag approach ensures that all relative links work correctly within the dashboard when accessed through the `/360` path.
