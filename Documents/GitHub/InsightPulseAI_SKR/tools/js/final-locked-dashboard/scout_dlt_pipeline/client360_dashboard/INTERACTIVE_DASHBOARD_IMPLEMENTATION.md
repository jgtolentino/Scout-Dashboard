### 4. Enhanced Interactive Geospatial Map

The map component has been completely reimagined:

- **Store Filtering**: Filter by region, performance metrics, and store type
- **Advanced Visualization**: Color-coded markers with variable radius based on performance
- **Heat Map Toggle**: Switch between discrete markers and heat map visualization
- **Detailed Store Cards**: Click stores to see comprehensive performance metrics
- **Custom Controls**: Added filter panel and store details panel
- **Map Legends**: Dynamic legends that update based on the selected metric

Technical implementation:
- Upgraded Leaflet.js integration with clustering support
- Implemented map filters with real-time updates
- Created heat map visualization layer
- Added detailed store information panels
- Implemented performance-optimized rendering

### 5. Dynamic AI Insight Panel

The AI Insights panel now features rich interaction:

- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Charts that respond to user interaction
- **Tabbed Interface**: Different categories of insights (Overview, Performance, Customer)
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Ability to implement AI recommendations directly
- **Insight Refresh**: Manually refresh insights with latest data
- **Timeframe Filtering**: See insights for specific time periods
- **Confidence Indicators**: Visual representation of AI confidence in insights

Technical implementation:
- Created tabbed interface for different insight types
- Implemented interactive Chart.js visualizations
- Added recommendation action modals
- Created insight detail expansion capability
- Implemented AI confidence visualization

### 6. Enhanced Data Source Toggle

Users can now easily switch between simulated and live data:

- **Visual Indicators**: Clear indication of current data source
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Prevents accidental switches to live data
- **Status Notifications**: Toast notifications when data source changes
- **Info Panel**: Detailed explanation of data source differences
- **Advanced Controls**: Additional options for data freshness and completeness

Technical implementation:
- Improved toggle switch with visual feedback
- Added confirmation dialog for live data switch
- Implemented toast notifications for source changes
- Created advanced data source control panel
- Added error simulation capabilities

### 7. Updated TBWA Theme with New Color Palette

The dashboard has been visually updated with:

- **New Color Scheme**: Azure Blue (#0052CC) primary, Yellow-Orange (#FFAB00) secondary
- **Consistent Styling**: Applied throughout all components
- **Theme Variants**: Support for multiple theme options (Azure Blue, Navy, Dark)
- **Enhanced Visual Hierarchy**: Clearer distinction between interactive and static elements
- **Improved Accessibility**: Better color contrast for readability

Technical implementation:
- Updated variables-tbwa.scss with new color palette
- Created dynamic theme application in dashboard.js
- Added theme switching capability
- Ensured consistent application across all components

```

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the enhanced dashboard:

1. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-enhanced-dashboard.sh
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Build the updated TBWA theme
   - Process all component files
   - Create a deployment package
   - Optionally deploy to Azure (if SWA CLI is available)

3. Verify the deployment using the generated verification report in `deploy/verification_report.html`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify filter bar updates URL parameters when filters are changed
- [ ] Test date picker with both preset and custom date ranges
- [ ] Click on KPI tiles to ensure drill-downs appear with relevant data
- [ ] Interact with the map to filter stores and view details
- [ ] Test the insights panel tabs and interactive charts
- [ ] Toggle between simulated and live data sources
- [ ] Verify theme colors are applied consistently

## Next Steps

Potential future enhancements include:

1. User-specific dashboard settings persistence
2. Additional visualization options for KPI drill-downs
3. Integration with real-time notification system
4. Mobile-optimized view for field staff
5. Performance optimization for large datasets

## Notes

- All interactive features maintain state via URL parameters to allow sharing of specific views
- The simulation vs. live data toggle includes safeguards to prevent accidental use of production data
- The enhanced map component will automatically handle additional store locations as they're added
- The AI insights panel refreshes its data based on the selected filters and time period
