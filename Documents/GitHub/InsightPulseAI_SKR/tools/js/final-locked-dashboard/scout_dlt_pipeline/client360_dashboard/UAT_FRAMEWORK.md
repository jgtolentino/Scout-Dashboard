# User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the UAT Framework for the Client360 Dashboard, which ensures that all deployed features match the requirements specified in the PRD.

## UAT Process

### 1. Pre-UAT Requirements

Before UAT begins:

- The feature has been deployed to a UAT environment
- The PRD has been reviewed and final acceptance criteria are clearly defined
- Test data is available in the UAT environment
- UAT participants have been identified and briefed

### 2. UAT Testing Process

1. **PRD Requirements Validation**
   - Every requirement in the PRD is converted to a testable item in the UAT checklist
   - Requirements must be specific and measurable
   - Each requirement must have a clear "pass" or "fail" outcome

2. **UAT Execution**
   - UAT participants follow the test script in the UAT template
   - Each test scenario is executed and results documented
   - Screenshots or recordings are captured for visual verification
   - Issues are documented with detailed reproduction steps

3. **Results Documentation**
   - All test results are documented in the UAT Report
   - Passed tests are marked as "PASS"
   - Failed tests are marked as "FAIL" with detailed notes
   - Conditional passes require approval and are marked as "CONDITIONAL PASS"

### 3. Post-UAT Actions

- Issues are prioritized and assigned for remediation
- Critical issues must be fixed before production deployment
- A re-test plan is created for failed items
- Final UAT sign-off is obtained only when all critical items pass

## UAT Template Structure

Every UAT must use the standardized UAT template (`templates/UAT_TEMPLATE.md`) which includes:

1. **Feature Information**
   - Feature name and description
   - PRD reference
   - UAT environment details
   - UAT participants

2. **Acceptance Criteria Checklist**
   - Derived directly from PRD requirements
   - Each item must be testable with clear pass/fail criteria
   - Grouped by functional area

3. **Test Scenarios**
   - Step-by-step test procedures
   - Expected results for each step
   - Actual results and status
   - Notes and observations

4. **Visual Verification**
   - Design specification vs. actual implementation comparison
   - Screenshot documentation
   - Color, layout, and styling validation

5. **Theme Consistency Validation**
   - TBWA theme compliance check
   - SariSari theme compliance check (if applicable)
   - Responsive design validation

6. **Performance Validation**
   - Load time measurements
   - Interactive response time
   - Resource utilization

7. **Issue Tracking**
   - Documented issues with severity levels
   - Reproduction steps
   - Assigned ownership
   - Resolution timeline

8. **Sign-off**
   - UAT participants sign-off
   - Product owner approval
   - Conditional approval notes (if applicable)

## Integration with Development Process

1. **PRD Development**
   - UAT criteria must be defined during PRD creation
   - Each requirement must have a corresponding UAT test case

2. **Implementation**
   - Developers review UAT criteria before starting work
   - Feature development must enable testability of all UAT items

3. **Deployment**
   - The deployed solution must pass automated verification
   - UAT is scheduled immediately following deployment
   - Production deployment awaits UAT sign-off

## UAT Completion Criteria

A feature is considered to have passed UAT when:

1. All critical acceptance criteria are marked as "PASS"
2. Any "CONDITIONAL PASS" items have approved remediation plans
3. The UAT report is signed off by all required stakeholders
4. The implemented feature visually and functionally matches the PRD specifications

## UAT Tools and Resources

- UAT Template (`templates/UAT_TEMPLATE.md`)
- Testing environment URL
- Screenshot capture tools
- Issue tracking system
- PRD documentation

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Product Owner**: Define acceptance criteria, prioritize issues, provide final sign-off
- **UAT Participants**: Execute test cases, document results, provide feedback
- **Development Team**: Fix identified issues, support UAT process
- **QA Lead**: Coordinate UAT, compile results, track issue resolution

## Timeline

- UAT should be scheduled immediately after deployment to UAT environment
- Initial UAT execution: 1-3 days depending on feature complexity
- Issue remediation: 1-5 days
- Re-testing: 1-2 days
- Final sign-off: 1 day

## Best Practices

1. Always test against acceptance criteria derived directly from the PRD
2. Document everything with screenshots and detailed notes
3. Test both positive and negative scenarios
4. Test all applicable themes and responsive layouts
5. Include stakeholders from different departments in UAT
6. Fix critical issues before proceeding to production
7. Maintain a repository of UAT reports for reference
