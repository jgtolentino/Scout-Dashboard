# Client360 Dashboard v2.4.0 Deployment Checklist

This checklist provides step-by-step guidance for deploying Client360 Dashboard v2.4.0 to production environments. Follow these instructions to ensure a successful and verified deployment.

## Pre-Deployment Preparation

### 1. Environment Verification
- [ ] Confirm Azure subscription is active and has sufficient quota
- [ ] Verify Azure resource group permissions
- [ ] Check Azure OpenAI API service availability in target region
- [ ] Confirm Static Web App service is available
- [ ] Validate all network access rules and firewall settings

### 2. Backup and Rollback Plan
- [ ] Create backup of current production environment (v2.3.3)
- [ ] Snapshot all configuration files
- [ ] Document current API endpoints and access tokens
- [ ] Prepare rollback script (`./scripts/rollback_to_v2.3.3.sh`)
- [ ] Verify rollback procedure with deployment team

### 3. Configuration Setup
- [ ] Update `.env.production` with environment-specific values
- [ ] Configure Azure OpenAI API keys and endpoints
- [ ] Set deployment-specific feature flags
- [ ] Update data source connection parameters
- [ ] Configure user authentication settings

### 4. Testing Environment
- [ ] Verify the build succeeds with production configurations
- [ ] Run all unit tests (`npm run test`)
- [ ] Complete UAT sign-off from stakeholders
- [ ] Conduct performance and load testing
- [ ] Validate security and compliance requirements

## Deployment Process

### 1. Preparation
- [ ] Stop monitoring alerts temporarily (to prevent false positives)
- [ ] Notify users of scheduled maintenance window
- [ ] Validate deployment credentials
- [ ] Run pre-deployment verification script (`./scripts/pre_deploy_check.sh`)

### 2. Build and Package
- [ ] Check out release branch (`git checkout release/v2.4.0`)
- [ ] Install dependencies (`npm install`)
- [ ] Build production assets (`npm run build:prod`)
- [ ] Run integrity checks on build output
- [ ] Create deployment package

### 3. Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to Azure Static Web App using one of the following methods:
  - Azure CLI: `az staticwebapp deploy --name client360-dashboard --source-location ./dist`
  - GitHub Actions: Trigger deployment workflow
  - Azure DevOps: Execute release pipeline
- [ ] Verify deployment status in Azure portal
- [ ] Update API configurations in Azure portal if needed

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Run verification script with multiple checks:
  ```bash
  ./verify_v2.4.0_deployment.sh --generate-report
  ```
- [ ] Check AI components:
  ```bash
  ./verify_v2.4.0_deployment.sh --component=ai-engine
  ```
- [ ] Check Map components:
  ```bash
  ./verify_v2.4.0_deployment.sh --component=map-component
  ```
- [ ] Check User Personalization components:
  ```bash
  ./verify_v2.4.0_deployment.sh --component=user-personalization
  ```
- [ ] Perform integrity verification:
  ```bash
  ./verify_v2.4.0_deployment.sh --integrity-only
  ```

### 5. Smoke Testing
- [ ] Validate the dashboard loads correctly
- [ ] Check all components render properly
- [ ] Verify Azure OpenAI API integration works
- [ ] Confirm map visualizations are functioning
- [ ] Test user personalization features
- [ ] Validate mobile responsiveness

## Post-Deployment Activities

### 1. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Re-enable monitoring alerts
- [ ] Set up new alerts for v2.4.0 specific features
- [ ] Configure AI usage monitoring
- [ ] Set up performance dashboards
- [ ] Establish error tracking and reporting

### 2. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer
- [ ] Update internal documentation
- [ ] Prepare user-facing release notes
- [ ] Conduct knowledge transfer sessions with support team
- [ ] Update FAQ documents
- [ ] Record training videos for new features

### 3. Announcements and Communication
- [ ] Send deployment success notification to stakeholders
- [ ] Update status page
- [ ] Publish release notes to users
- [ ] Schedule follow-up user training sessions
- [ ] Collect initial feedback

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### AI Component Issues
- If AI insights fail to load, check:
  - Azure OpenAI API key configuration
  - Network connectivity to Azure OpenAI endpoint
  - Fallback mechanisms in `ai_engine.js`
  - Browser console for specific error messages

### Map Visualization Problems
- If map fails to render:
  - Verify Mapbox token is valid
  - Check network requests for GeoJSON data
  - Ensure WebGL is supported by the browser
  - Validate map settings in configuration

### User Personalization Failures
- If user settings don't persist:
  - Check browser localStorage access
  - Verify user authentication is working
  - Check network connectivity for preference syncing
  - Clear browser cache and retry

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are encountered and immediate resolution is not possible:

1. Execute rollback script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/rollback_to_v2.3.3.sh
   ```

2. Verify the rollback was successful:
   ```bash
   ./verify_v2.3.3_deployment.sh
   ```

3. Notify stakeholders of the rollback and provide timeline for retry

4. Document all issues encountered for resolution before attempting deployment again
