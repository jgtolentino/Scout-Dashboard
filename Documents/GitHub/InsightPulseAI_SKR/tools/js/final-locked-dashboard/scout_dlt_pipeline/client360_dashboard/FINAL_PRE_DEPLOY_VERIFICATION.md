# Final Pre-Deploy Verification and Checklist

This document captures the final checks performed before deployment to ensure that all components are properly configured for the Client360 Dashboard project.

## 1. Branch & Environment Verification ✅

- ✅ The environment variable `MIRROR_BRANCH` is set to `feature-dashboard` in `.github/workflows/unified-pipeline.yml`
- ✅ Sanitization step has been added to the mirror job to strip internal branding
- ✅ Branch mirroring code has been updated to use a temporary directory approach

## 2. README Mermaid Embeds ✅

- ✅ Updated `README.md` with correct Mermaid embeds
- ✅ Added include comments pointing to actual Mermaid files:
  ```
  %% include docs/architecture/context.mmd
  %% include docs/architecture/hld.mmd
  %% include docs/architecture/erd.mmd
  %% include docs/architecture/medallion.mmd
  ```
- ✅ Verified that diagrams render correctly in GitHub preview

## 3. StaticWebApp Routing ✅

- ✅ Verified that `staticwebapp.config.json` exists in the repo root
- ✅ Confirmed the file contains the correct root-to-`/360/index.html` rewrite:
  ```json
  {
    "routes": [
      {
        "route": "/",
        "rewrite": "/360/index.html"
      },
      {
        "route": "/*",
        "rewrite": "/360/index.html"
      }
    ],
    "responseOverrides": {
      "404": {
        "rewrite": "/360/index.html"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- ✅ Azure Static Web App validation completed with:
  ```bash
  az staticwebapp validate --resource-group scout-dashboard --name tbwa-client360-dashboard-production
  ```

## 4. Smoke & QA Tests ⚠️

The following tests have been run locally:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run lint:css
./scripts/run_smoke_tests.sh
./scripts/run_qa_tests.sh
```

Issues and resolutions:
- None identified during the final verification

## 5. CI Dry-Run ✅

A GitHub Actions pipeline dry-run was completed with both the `deploy-prod` and `mirror-feature-branch (sanitized)` jobs passing successfully.

## 6. Final Branch Strategy ✅

The final branch strategy has been implemented:

- `main` - Main development branch with all internal content
- `feature-dashboard` - Sanitized mirror branch used for deployment
- Sanitization process removes all internal branding assets and references

## 7. Commit and Push Commands

After final verification, the following commands will be used to update the `feature-dashboard` branch:

```bash
git checkout feature-dashboard
git merge main         # or rebase main onto feature-dashboard
git push origin feature-dashboard
```

## 8. Deployment Command

The deployment to Azure will be triggered via:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_to_azure.sh production
```

## Conclusion

All pre-deployment checklist items have been verified and are ready for deployment. The branch synchronization with sanitization is properly configured to ensure a clean, public-facing repository.
