# TBWA Client360 Dashboard CSS Fix

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the CSS styling fix applied to the TBWA Client360 Dashboard, with particular focus on ensuring the rollback component is properly styled.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Rollback Component Styles**: Added explicit styles for the rollback dashboard component
2. **Missing CSS Variables**: Added explicit variables for the rollback component styling
3. **CSS Build Process**: Fixed issues with the SCSS compilation process
4. **Deployment Verification**: Added checks to ensure rollback styles are included in the deployment
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Created safety nets to ensure styles work even if build process fails

## Quick Start

To fix the CSS issues and deploy the corrected dashboard, follow these steps:

1. **Run the comprehensive fix script**:
   ```bash
   ./fix_dashboard_styles.sh
   ```
   This script will:
   - Add necessary variables and styles to theme files
   - Build the TBWA theme CSS
   - Create deployment files in the `deploy` directory
   - Generate documentation and deployment scripts

2. **Deploy the fixed dashboard**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy_fixed_dashboard.sh
   ```
   This will deploy the fixed dashboard to Azure Static Web Apps.

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Using the Provided Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the all-in-one deployment script
./deploy_fixed_dashboard.sh
```

This script will:
- Package the fixed CSS files and dashboard assets
- Deploy to Azure using the stored API key
- Verify the deployment was successful
- Generate a deployment report

### Option 2: Azure CLI (Manual)

If you prefer to deploy manually with the Azure CLI:

```bash
# Set variables
RESOURCE_GROUP="scout-dashboard"
STATIC_WEB_APP_NAME="tbwa-client360-dashboard-production"
API_KEY="your-azure-api-key" # Get this from Azure Portal or az CLI

# Create deployment package
cd deploy
zip -r ../fixed_dashboard.zip *
cd ..

# Deploy to Azure Static Web App
az staticwebapp deploy \
  --name $STATIC_WEB_APP_NAME \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --source fixed_dashboard.zip \
  --api-key "$API_KEY"
```

### Option 3: Azure Portal (Manual)

1. Log in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to the "tbwa-client360-dashboard-production" Static Web App resource
3. Go to Deployment > Manual Deploy
4. Upload the `deploy` directory or a zip of its contents

## Verification

After deployment, run the verification script:

```bash
./scripts/verify_rollback_styles.sh
```

This will check if:
- Rollback styles are included in the theme source files
- Rollback styles are present in the compiled CSS
- Create emergency fallback styles if needed

You can also run a comprehensive deployment verification:

```bash
./verify_css_fix_final.sh
```

## Visual Verification

After successful deployment, visually verify:
- The rollback dashboard component has the proper styling (blue border, correct button colors)
- TBWA branding colors appear correctly (Navy #002B80 and Cyan #00C3EC)
- All dashboard components use the proper styling
- No CSS errors appear in the browser console

## Fallback Solutions

If you see styling issues with the rollback component after deployment, you can manually add this line to the HTML files in your deployment:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/rollback-styles.css">
```

The fix script creates this fallback file which contains explicit styles for the rollback component.

## Files Updated

The fix updates the following files:

- `src/styles/variables-tbwa.scss`: Added explicit variables for rollback component styling
- `src/themes/tbwa.scss`: Added complete rollback component styles
- `scripts/build-tbwa-theme.sh`: Enhanced to ensure rollback styles are included
- `scripts/deploy_tbwa_theme.sh`: Improved to verify rollback styles exist in compiled CSS
- `deploy_to_azure.sh`: Updated to add fallback CSS when needed

## Support

If issues persist after deployment:
- Review the logs in the `logs/` directory for detailed error messages
- Check the verification reports in the `reports/` directory
- Run the individual scripts to isolate the problem:
  - `scripts/build-tbwa-theme.sh`
  - `scripts/verify_rollback_styles.sh`
  - `scripts/deploy_tbwa_theme.sh`
