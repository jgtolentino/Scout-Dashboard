## Deployment Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Azure Static Web App environment
- Azure OpenAI API access (for AI features)
- Node.js 18+ (for build tools)
### Deployment Steps
1. Clone the repository and checkout the `v2.4.0` tag
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Configure environment variables in `.env.production`
4. Build the project with `npm run build:prod`
5. Deploy to Azure Static Web App using the Azure CLI or GitHub Actions
6. Verify deployment with `./verify_v2.4.0_deployment.sh`
### Configuration
Key configuration options can be set in the following files:
- `config/ai_models.json`: Configure AI models and fallback behavior
- `config/map_settings.json`: Customize map visualization defaults
- `config/user_preferences.json`: Set default user personalization options
## Backward Compatibility
Client360 Dashboard v2.4.0 maintains backward compatibility with existing data sources and APIs used in v2.3.3. The following compatibility considerations should be noted:
- The AI Insights API format has been extended but remains compatible with v2.3.3
- Custom dashboards layouts created in earlier versions will be automatically migrated
- Stored user preferences will be preserved and mapped to new preference schema
- All existing REST API endpoints continue to function as before
## Known Issues
- AI streaming response may have higher latency on slower connections
- Map heatmap visualization requires WebGL 2.0 support in the browser
- Some older browsers (IE11, older Safari versions) may have limited functionality
- Custom export templates are limited to 10 per user
