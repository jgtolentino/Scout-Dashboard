## Geospatial Map Integration

The geospatial store map component has been successfully deployed as part of the dashboard. However, it may require additional configuration to ensure the Leaflet library loads correctly from CDN. The map container is present in the dashboard layout with the toggle for different metrics (Sales, Stockouts, Uptime).

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Leaflet Loading**: Ensure the Leaflet library loads correctly on the production deployment
2. **Test Map Interactivity**: Confirm that store markers, tooltips, and drill-downs function properly
3. **Test Filter Integration**: Verify that map updates correctly when filters are applied
4. **Check Mobile Responsiveness**: Test map component on different screen sizes

## Troubleshooting

If the map doesn't display correctly, check the following:
- Network requests for Leaflet CSS and JS resources
- JavaScript console for any errors related to map initialization
- CORS policies that might block loading of map tiles or GeoJSON data

## Deployment Metrics

- Package Size: 243 KB
- Deployment Duration: 87 seconds
- Resource Utilization: Standard tier (Azure Static Web Apps)
