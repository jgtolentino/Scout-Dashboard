# Client360 Dashboard CSS Fix Implementation: Complete

## Overview

The CSS styling issues with the TBWA Client360 Dashboard have been successfully addressed. This document summarizes the implemented fixes and provides verification guidance.

## Issue Summary

The dashboard was experiencing issues with the TBWA CSS and theme styling not being properly applied. The root causes were identified as:

1. Missing reference to `variables.css` in the HTML file
2. Incorrect content-type headers for CSS files in Azure Static Web App configuration
3. Incomplete MIME type and route configurations in `staticwebapp.config.json`

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. HTML CSS References

The HTML file's head section has been updated to include all required CSS files in the correct order:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/variables.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/tbwa-theme.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/dashboard.css">
```

This order is critical because:
- `variables.css` defines CSS custom properties including TBWA brand colors
- `tbwa-theme.css` applies the theme using those variables
- `dashboard.css` applies additional styling

### 2. Azure Configuration

The `staticwebapp.config.json` file has been enhanced with:

- Explicit routes for CSS files with proper content-type headers
- Expanded MIME type mappings for all file types
- Updated content security policy to allow all required resources

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "route": "/css/*.css",
      "headers": {
        "content-type": "text/css"
      }
    }
  ],
  "mimeTypes": {
    ".css": "text/css",
    ".js": "application/javascript",
    ".html": "text/html",
    ".png": "image/png",
    ".jpg": "image/jpeg",
    ".svg": "image/svg+xml",
    ".geojson": "application/json"
  }
}
```

### 3. Rollback Implementation

A comprehensive rollback approach was used that:

- Created backups of the current deployment state
- Restored working files from a known good version
- Added verification scripts to validate the fix
- Generated deployment packages for Azure Static Web App

## Verification

The implementation has been verified on the development environment and is ready for production deployment. To verify the fix after deployment:

1. Run the verification script to check CSS content types:
   ```bash
   ./verify_css_fix_final.sh https://blue-coast-0acb6880f.6.azurestaticapps.net
   ```

2. Visually confirm:
   - TBWA branding is visible (yellow #ffc300 and blue #005bbb)
   - Dashboard components have correct styling
   - KPI tiles have yellow top borders
   - Charts use the correct color palette

## Deployment Instructions

For detailed deployment steps, refer to [MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./MANUAL_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md).
