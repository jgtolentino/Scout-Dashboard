# Store Map Component Implementation Summary

## Overview

The enhanced geospatial store map component has been successfully implemented for the TBWA Client360 Dashboard. This component provides a rich, interactive visualization of store locations across the Philippines with detailed performance metrics.

## Implementation Details

### Components Created

1. **JavaScript Component**
   - Created `src/components/store_map.js` - a fully featured map visualization class
   - Implemented interactive markers with tooltips and drill-down functionality
   - Added support for multiple metrics with dynamic color scales
   - Incorporated filtering and theme compatibility

2. **Styling**
   - Created `src/styles/store-map.scss` with responsive design
   - Used theme variables for consistent visual styling
   - Added theme-specific overrides for TBWA and Sari-Sari themes
   - Styled map controls, tooltips, and drill-down views

3. **Build System**
   - Added store-map imports to theme SCSS files
   - Created build-components.sh script for the JavaScript build process
   - Updated deployment scripts to include the store map component
   - Added proper references in the HTML template

4. **Documentation**
   - Updated README_STORE_MAP.md with comprehensive documentation
   - Included usage examples, configuration options, and extension points
   - Documented the component's integration with the dashboard
   - Added suggestions for future enhancements

5. **Testing**
   - Created test_store_map.sh script to verify component integrity
   - Added checks for file existence, build process, and integration

### Key Features

The implemented store map component includes:

- **Interactive Map** with smooth navigation controls
- **Multiple Metrics Visualization** (Sales, Customers, Growth Rate, etc.)
- **Dynamic Styling** based on metric values
- **Detailed Tooltips** with store information
- **Advanced Drill-Down** with performance history and category breakdown
- **Theme Support** with seamless integration of TBWA and Sari-Sari themes
- **Mobile Responsiveness** for all screen sizes
- **Fallback Mechanisms** for when data is unavailable

### Integration Points

The component integrates with the dashboard through:

1. HTML container in the template
2. Metric selector dropdown for switching visualizations
3. Filter system for regional and store type filtering
4. Event system for drill-down interactions
5. Theme system for visual consistency

## Next Steps

1. Run the test script to verify all components are functioning properly:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test_store_map.sh
   ```

2. Review the updated documentation to understand the component's capabilities:
   ```bash
   cat README_STORE_MAP.md
   ```

3. Consider future enhancements mentioned in the documentation, including:
   - Marker clustering for dense regions
   - Heatmap visualization mode
   - Time-based animation for metric changes
   - Additional analysis tools for comparison

The implementation is now complete and ready for integration into the main dashboard deployment.
