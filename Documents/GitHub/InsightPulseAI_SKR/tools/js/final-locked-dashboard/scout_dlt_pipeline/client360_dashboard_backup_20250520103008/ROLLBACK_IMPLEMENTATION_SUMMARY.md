# Client360 Dashboard Rollback Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the rollback implementation performed for the Client360 Dashboard to fix the issue with TBWA CSS and theme styling not being properly applied. The rollback approach included both restoration of the correct file structure and configuration updates to ensure proper content-type headers.

## Issues Identified

1. The CSS files were not being served with the correct `text/css` content-type headers
2. The CSS load order in the HTML was not properly configured with `variables.css` missing from the header
3. The `staticwebapp.config.json` had incomplete route configurations for CSS files

## Implementation Details

### 1. Rollback Script Creation

A custom rollback script (`execute_rollback.sh`) was created to:
- Back up the current deployment directory
- Extract the rollback files from a known working version ZIP
- Verify essential files were present
- Create a new deployment package for manual deployment
- Generate a verification checklist

### 2. CSS Reference Fix

The HTML file was updated to include all necessary CSS references in the correct order:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/variables.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/tbwa-theme.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/dashboard.css">
```

The proper CSS load order is critical because:
- `variables.css` defines the CSS custom properties (including TBWA brand colors)
- `tbwa-theme.css` uses these variables for consistent theme application
- `dashboard.css` applies additional styling based on the theme

### 3. Configuration Updates

The `staticwebapp.config.json` file was updated to properly handle CSS files:

- Added explicit routes for CSS files with the correct content-type headers:
```json
{
  "route": "/css/*.css",
  "headers": {
    "content-type": "text/css"
  }
}
```

- Updated the MIME types mapping to ensure proper content-type headers:
```json
"mimeTypes": {
  ".css": "text/css",
  ".js": "application/javascript",
  ".html": "text/html",
  ".png": "image/png",
  ".jpg": "image/jpeg",
  ".svg": "image/svg+xml",
  ".geojson": "application/json"
}
```

- Enhanced the Content Security Policy to allow necessary resources:
```json
"content-security-policy": "default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://*.azurewebsites.net https://unpkg.com https://fonts.googleapis.com https://fonts.gstatic.com;"
```

### 4. Deployment Package

A new deployment package was created with all the fixes, named `client360_dashboard_final_fix_<timestamp>.zip`. This package is ready for manual deployment through the Azure Portal.

## Verification Process

A verification process was defined to ensure the rollback was successful:

1. Deploy the fixed package via the Azure Portal
2. Verify CSS files are being served with the correct content-type headers
3. Verify the TBWA branding (yellow #ffc300 and blue #005bbb) is properly displayed
4. Verify all CSS styling is correctly applied to the dashboard
5. Complete the verification checklist for thorough validation

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the final fix package via the Azure Portal:
   - Login to Azure Portal
   - Navigate to the Static Web App resource
   - Go to Deployment > Manual Deploy
   - Upload the fix package ZIP file

2. Complete the verification checklist to ensure all styling and functionality works as expected

3. Document any remaining issues for future improvements

## Conclusion

The rollback implementation addresses the root cause of the styling issues by ensuring proper CSS references, content-type headers, and configuration. This approach should restore the TBWA branding and styling to the Client360 Dashboard.
