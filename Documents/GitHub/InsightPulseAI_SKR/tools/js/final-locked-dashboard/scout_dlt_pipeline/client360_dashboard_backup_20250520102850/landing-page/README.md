## Customization

### Colors and Branding

#### For index.html:
Edit the CSS variables in `css/styles.css`:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #ffc300;  /* TBWA yellow */
  --secondary-color: #000000;  /* TBWA black */
  --accent-color: #005bbb;  /* TBWA blue */
  ...
}
```

#### For client-360.html:

```css
:root{
  --tbwa-blue:#0056FF;
  --tbwa-blue-dark:#0047B3;
  --tbwa-warning:#FFD300;
  ...
}
```

### Content Updates

#### For index.html:
Edit the various sections in the HTML file directly.

#### For client-360.html:
The content is organized into clearly commented sections that can be edited directly:
```html
<!-- HERO --------------------------------------------------- -->
<header class="section bg-blue" style="text-align:center">
  <h1 style="font-size:2.75rem;font-weight:700;margin:0 0 1rem">Client 360</h1>
  ...
</header>
```

## Integration with Main Dashboard

Both landing pages are designed to complement the TBWA-themed Client360 Dashboard. Update the demo/preview links to point to your deployed dashboard URL.
