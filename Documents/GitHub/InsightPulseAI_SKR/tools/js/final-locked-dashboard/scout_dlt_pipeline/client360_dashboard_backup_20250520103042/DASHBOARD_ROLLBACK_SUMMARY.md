# Scout Advisor Dashboard Rollback Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a robust rollback system for the Scout Advisor Dashboard. The rollback system allows for quick restoration of a known working dashboard version in case of deployment issues, styling problems, or other critical issues.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Rollback Script

A comprehensive rollback script has been created at `scripts/rollback_dashboard.sh` that:

- Extracts the known working version from a git tag (`golden-20250519`)
- Creates a backup of the current dashboard version
- Restores the working version files (including geospatial store map component)
- Creates a deployment package
- Offers to deploy directly to Azure Static Web App
- Generates a verification checklist

The script includes error handling, logging, and user prompts to ensure a smooth rollback process.

### 2. Verification Script

A verification script has been created at `scripts/verify_rollback.sh` that:

- Checks accessibility of the deployed dashboard
- Verifies CSS and JavaScript file accessibility
- Specifically verifies geospatial store map component files
- Checks for Leaflet library availability (for map rendering)
- Takes a screenshot for visual verification (when available)
- Generates a detailed verification report
- Provides guidance for manual verification steps including map functionality

### 3. Documentation

The following documentation has been added:

- `DASHBOARD_ROLLBACK_GUIDE.md`: Comprehensive guide for the rollback process
- `DASHBOARD_ROLLBACK_SUMMARY.md`: This summary document
- Updated `README.md`: Added information about the rollback process

### 4. Verification Templates

The rollback process generates the following verification documents:

- `DASHBOARD_ROLLBACK_VERIFICATION.md`: Checklist for verifying the rollback
- Verification reports in the `reports` directory

## Rollback Process

The implemented rollback process follows these steps:

1. Execute the rollback script: `./scripts/rollback_dashboard.sh`
2. Confirm deployment to Azure (or deploy manually)
3. Verify the rollback using the verification script: `./scripts/verify_rollback.sh`
4. Complete the verification checklist in `DASHBOARD_ROLLBACK_VERIFICATION.md`
5. Document any issues or follow-up actions required

## Golden Tag System

The rollback system relies on git tags to mark stable, production-ready versions of the dashboard. The current golden version is tagged as `golden-20250519`, which points to a commit with a properly styled and fully functional dashboard.

## Next Steps

1. Create regular golden tags for stable deployments
2. Add the rollback script to CI/CD pipeline for emergency use
3. Train team members on the rollback procedure
4. Consider automating more of the verification process

## Conclusion

The implemented rollback system provides a reliable mechanism for quickly restoring a working version of the Scout Advisor Dashboard in case of issues. This minimizes downtime and ensures that users always have access to a functional dashboard.
