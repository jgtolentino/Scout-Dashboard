# CI/CD Setup Complete for Client360 Dashboard

## Overview

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) has been configured for the Client360 Dashboard. This setup automates the build, test, and deployment process, ensuring consistent deployments with minimal manual intervention.

## Components Implemented

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

- **CI/CD Pipeline** (.github/workflows/ci-cd-client360.yml)
  - Builds and deploys the dashboard on pushes to the main branch
  - Uses Azure infrastructure as code (Bicep) for resource provisioning
  - Implements a staging and production slot deployment strategy
  - Includes automated Cypress smoke tests
  - Features automatic rollback on failure

- **Monitoring & Alerting** (.github/workflows/azure-monitor-alert.yml)
  - Sends Slack notifications on successful deployments
  - Integrates with team communication channels

### 2. Infrastructure as Code

- **Bicep Template** (infrastructure/main.bicep)
  - Defines Azure Static Web App resources
  - Maintains consistent infrastructure configuration
  - Enables version control of infrastructure settings

### 3. Deployment Scripts

- **CI/CD Deployment Script** (scripts/cicd-deploy.sh)
  - Provides a portable deployment process
  - Can be run locally or within CI/CD pipeline
  - Offers consistent deployment across environments

## Deployment Process

The CI/CD pipeline follows these steps:

1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Provisions or updates Azure resources using Bicep templates
   - Ensures consistent environment configuration

2. **Build & Deploy**
   - Installs dependencies
   - Builds the application
   - Deploys to a staging slot
   - Runs automated Cypress tests against the staging environment
   - Swaps staging to production if tests pass

3. **Monitoring & Rollback**
   - Automatically rolls back to previous version if deployment fails
   - Sends notifications on deployment status

## Configuration Requirements

To use this CI/CD setup, you need to configure the following GitHub secrets:

- `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`: Service principal credentials with permissions to the Azure subscription
- `SLACK_CHANNEL`: Slack channel ID for notifications
- `STATIC_APP_URL`: The URL of your Azure Static Web App

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Required Secrets**
   - Add the required secrets to your GitHub repository

2. **Review First Deployment**
   - Monitor the first automatic deployment
   - Verify all components are working as expected

3. **Extend Test Coverage**
   - Add more comprehensive Cypress tests
   - Implement visual regression testing

4. **Add Performance Monitoring**
   - Configure Azure Application Insights
   - Set up performance tracking and alerting

## Conclusion

The CI/CD setup for the Client360 Dashboard is now complete and ready for use. This automation will streamline the development process, reduce deployment errors, and enable faster delivery of updates.
