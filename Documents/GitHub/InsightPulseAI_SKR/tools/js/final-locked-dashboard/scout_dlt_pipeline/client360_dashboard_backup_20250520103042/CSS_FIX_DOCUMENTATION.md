# TBWA CSS and Theme Fix Documentation

## Issue Overview

The dashboard was experiencing an issue where the TBWA CSS and theme styling was not being correctly applied. This caused the dashboard to display without the proper TBWA branding, colors, and styling.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigation, the following issues were identified:

1. **Content-Type Headers**: The Azure Static Web App was not correctly serving CSS files with the appropriate `text/css` content type, leading browsers to not apply the styles correctly.

2. **Cache Control**: Missing cache control headers meant that browsers might be caching the incorrect content type or outdated CSS files.

3. **MIME Type Mapping**: Incomplete MIME type mappings in the Azure Static Web App configuration, causing some file types to be served with incorrect content types.

## Solution Implemented

The solution focused on updating the `staticwebapp.config.json` file to include:

1. **Explicit Routes for CSS Files**: Added explicit routes with the correct content type headers for CSS files.
   ```json
   {
     "route": "/css/*.css",
     "headers": {
       "content-type": "text/css"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Cache Control Headers**: Added cache control headers to prevent caching issues.
   ```json
   "Cache-Control": "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
   ```

3. **Comprehensive MIME Type Mappings**: Added mappings for all file types used in the dashboard.
   ```json
   "mimeTypes": {
     ".css": "text/css",
     ".js": "application/javascript",
     // Additional mappings...
   }
   ```

## Files Modified

- `/deploy/staticwebapp.config.json` - Updated configuration for Azure Static Web App

## Deployment and Verification

Two scripts were created to assist with deployment and verification:

1. `deploy_css_fix.sh` - Script to create a deployment package and deploy it to Azure
2. `verify_css_fix.sh` - Script to verify that the fix was correctly applied

To deploy the fix:
```
./deploy_css_fix.sh
```

To verify the fix:
```
./verify_css_fix.sh
```

## Expected Results After Fix

After applying the fix, the following should be observed:

- All CSS files are served with the `text/css` content type
- The TBWA branding is visible throughout the dashboard
- KPI tiles have the yellow (#ffc300) border at the top
- Charts use the TBWA color palette with blue (#005bbb) as the primary color
- No content type or CORS errors in the browser console

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after applying the fix:

1. Verify that the `staticwebapp.config.json` file was correctly deployed
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify network requests to ensure CSS files are being served with correct content types
5. Ensure all CSS files are correctly referenced in the HTML files
