## Data Flow Architecture

The deployed system follows this data flow:

1. **Edge Devices (Raspberry Pi)**
   - Capture audio via microphone â†’ Speech-to-text processing
   - Capture video via camera â†’ Face/gesture detection
   - Send processed events to Event Hubs

2. **Azure Event Hubs**
   - `eh-pi-stt-raw`: Raw speech-to-text data
   - `eh-pi-visual-stream`: Raw visual detection data
   - `eh-pi-annotated-events`: Processed multimodal events
   - `eh-device-heartbeat`: Device health monitoring

3. **Databricks Delta Live Tables**
   - **Bronze Layer:** Raw data ingestion
   - **Silver Layer:** Data transformation and enrichment
   - **Gold Layer:** Business insights and KPIs

4. **Backup Storage**
   - Azure Blob Storage for raw audio/video data

## Metrics & Performance

- **Expected Throughput:** 100+ events/second
- **Processing Latency:** < 5 seconds
- **Storage Efficiency:** JSON event data with optional blob backup
- **Pipeline Uptime:** Expected 99.9% availability

## Next Steps

1. **Device Deployment**
   - Deploy client software to Raspberry Pi devices using provided scripts
   - Configure device-specific settings
   - Verify data flow from devices to cloud

2. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure alerts for pipeline failures
   - Set up dashboard for system health
   - Implement automatic system recovery

3. **Analytics Integration**
   - Connect Power BI dashboard to gold tables
   - Configure scheduled report generation
   - Share insights with business stakeholders

4. **Production Hardening**
   - Rotate SAS tokens on regular schedule
   - Implement advanced security monitoring
   - Establish backup and disaster recovery plan
