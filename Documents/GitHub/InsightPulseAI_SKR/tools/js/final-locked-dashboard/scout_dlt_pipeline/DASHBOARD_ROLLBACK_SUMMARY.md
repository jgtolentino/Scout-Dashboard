# Scout Dashboard Rollback Summary (May 19, 2025)

## Overview

This document summarizes the rollback of recent changes to the Scout DLT Pipeline that deprecated the AudioURL field. The rollback restores audio file storage and processing functionality to maintain compatibility with existing dashboard features and analytics.

## Rollback Details

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Date** | May 19, 2025 |
| **Branch** | `rollback-dashboard-2025-05-19` |
| **Reason** | Maintain dashboard compatibility and analytics features requiring audio access |
| **Scope** | DLT Pipeline, Database Schema, Raspberry Pi Clients |
| **Contact** | DevOps Team (devops@example.com) |

## Changes Reverted

The following changes were reverted:

1. **Schema Changes**:
   - Restored AudioURL field to bronze_transcriptions table
   - Enabled audio file references in the pipeline

2. **ETL Configuration**:
   - Re-enabled audio file storage in blob storage
   - Restored audio backup in etl-deploy-kit.yaml

3. **Raspberry Pi Clients**:
   - Re-enabled audio file uploads from edge devices
   - Restored audio processing and upload functionality

4. **Documentation**:
   - Updated documentation to reflect audio storage is active
   - Added rollback guide and notes

## Implementation Steps

The rollback was implemented through:

1. **Automated Scripts**:
   - `rollback_pipeline.sh`: Reverts DLT pipeline configuration
   - `migrations/restore_audio_url.sql`: Restores database schema
   - `pi_deployment_sim/update_pi_clients.sh`: Updates Raspberry Pi clients

2. **Manual Verification**:
   - Pipeline operation verification
   - Data flow validation
   - Dashboard functionality testing

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts:
- Restored full functionality to dashboards requiring audio references
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing analytics
- Simplified immediate operations by returning to known stable state

### Considerations:
- Increased storage costs due to audio file storage
- Increased bandwidth usage from edge devices
- Privacy implications of storing audio recordings (mitigated by existing policies)

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor System Performance**:
   - Watch for any issues related to audio storage or processing
   - Monitor blob storage costs and usage

2. **Long-term Planning**:
   - Review dashboard dependencies on audio files
   - Develop alternative solution that doesn't require audio storage
   - Plan for future migration with proper lead time

3. **Communication**:
   - Inform all stakeholders about the rollback
   - Document dependencies for future reference

## Appendix: Key Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `scout_bronze_dlt.py` | Restored AudioURL field to schema |
| `etl-deploy-kit.yaml` | Re-enabled audio blob storage config |
| `migrations/restore_audio_url.sql` | Added SQL to restore schema |
| `pi_deployment_sim/update_pi_clients.sh` | Script to update Pi clients |
| `DASHBOARD_ROLLBACK_GUIDE.md` | Detailed rollback instructions |

**Note**: This rollback is considered a temporary measure to maintain system functionality. A future implementation will address the audio storage concerns in a way that maintains dashboard compatibility while addressing storage, bandwidth, and privacy considerations.
