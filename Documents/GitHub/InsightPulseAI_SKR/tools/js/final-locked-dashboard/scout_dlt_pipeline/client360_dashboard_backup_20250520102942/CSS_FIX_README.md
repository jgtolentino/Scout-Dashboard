# TBWA Client360 Dashboard CSS Fix

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the CSS styling fix applied to the TBWA Client360 Dashboard.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing CSS References**: Added the missing reference to variables.css in the HTML head
2. **Incorrect CSS Load Order**: Ensured proper load order (variables → theme → dashboard)
3. **Content-Type Headers**: Updated Azure configuration to serve CSS with proper headers
4. **Configuration Updates**: Enhanced staticwebapp.config.json with proper MIME types

## Deployment Package

A deployment package has been created and is ready for use:
`client360_dashboard_automated_fix_20250519210729.zip`

This package has been copied to your Desktop for easy access.

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Azure CLI (Recommended)

If you have the Azure CLI installed and configured:

```bash
# Set variables
RESOURCE_GROUP="InsightPulseAI-RG"
STATIC_WEB_APP_NAME="tbwa-client360-dashboard"

# Deploy to Azure Static Web App
az staticwebapp deploy \
  --name $STATIC_WEB_APP_NAME \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --source-path "/Users/tbwa/Documents/GitHub/InsightPulseAI_SKR/tools/js/final-locked-dashboard/scout_dlt_pipeline/client360_dashboard/deploy"
```

### Option 2: Azure Portal (Manual)

1. Log in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to the "tbwa-client360-dashboard" Static Web App resource
3. Go to Deployment > Manual Deploy
4. Upload the deployment package from your Desktop

## Verification

```bash
/Users/tbwa/Documents/GitHub/InsightPulseAI_SKR/tools/js/final-locked-dashboard/scout_dlt_pipeline/client360_dashboard/verify_css_fix_headless.sh
```

This will check if:
- CSS files are being served with the correct content-type headers
