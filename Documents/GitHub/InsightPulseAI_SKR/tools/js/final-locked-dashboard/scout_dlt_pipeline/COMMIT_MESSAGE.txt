rollback: Restore AudioURL field to Scout DLT pipeline

This commit restores the AudioURL field to the Scout DLT pipeline that was 
recently deprecated. The rollback was necessary to maintain compatibility
with existing dashboard features and analytics that depend on audio file
access.

Changes include:
- Restored AudioURL field in bronze_transcriptions schema
- Re-enabled audio file storage in Azure Blob Storage
- Added SQL script to restore database schema
- Updated Raspberry Pi client scripts to re-enable audio uploads
- Added test data with AudioURL field for validation
- Created rollback documentation and guides
- Added demonstration script for the rollback process

Note: This is a temporary rollback to maintain system functionality.
A future implementation will address audio storage concerns in a way
that maintains dashboard compatibility.
