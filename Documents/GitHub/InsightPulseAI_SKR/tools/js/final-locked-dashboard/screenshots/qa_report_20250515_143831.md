# Dashboard QA Report

## Screenshot Capture Details
- **Filename**: retail_dashboard_20250515_143831.png
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080
- **Capture Method**: Puppeteer automated browser capture
- **Path**: /Users/tbwa/Documents/GitHub/InsightPulseAI_SKR/tools/js/final-locked-dashboard/screenshots/retail_dashboard_20250515_143831.png

## Deployment Information
- **URL**: https://gentle-rock-04e54f40f.6.azurestaticapps.net/advisor
- **Timestamp**: May 15, 2025 14:38:31
- **Deployment Status**: ⚠️ FAILED
- **HTTP Status**: 404 Not Found

## Observations
- The deployment URL returns a 404 status code
- All tested paths return 404 status codes:
  - /
  - /index.html
  - /insights_dashboard.html
  - /advisor
  - /advisor/index.html
- The screenshot confirms a 404 Not Found Azure Static Web App error page
- The `staticwebapp.config.json` file is properly configured with routes for:
  - /advisor → /advisor/index.html
  - /edge → /edge/index.html
  - /ops → /ops/index.html
  - And appropriate redirects for legacy URLs
- Deployment appears to have failed or files were not correctly uploaded to Azure

## Config Analysis
```json
{
  "routes": [
    { 
      "route": "/advisor", 
      "rewrite": "/advisor/index.html" 
    },
    ...
  ],
  "navigationFallback": {
    "rewrite": "/index.html",
    "exclude": ["/images/*.{png,jpg,gif}", "/css/*", "/js/*", "/assets/*"]
  },
  "globalHeaders": {
    "X-Dashboard-Tag": "scout_dashboards_clean_urls",
    "X-Patch-ID": "dashboard-url-structure-v1",
    "X-Client-Context": "TBWA-direct-only"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Check if files were actually deployed to Azure (run deployment verification)
2. Review Azure Static Web App deployment logs in Azure Portal
3. Verify that the path structure on deployed files matches the config expectations
4. Check if deployment process completed successfully without errors
5. Re-deploy with detailed logging enabled
6. Consider checking if the app service is running or stopped in Azure Portal
