# Superset to Static Azure Web App Migration Report

This document outlines the migration from Superset-powered dashboards to Static Azure Web App deployments for the Scout Edge dashboard. The migration addresses the deprecation of Superset while maintaining all dashboard functionality through pre-rendered, filterable, client-ready JSON datasets.

## 1. Migration Overview

### 1.1 Previous Architecture

The previous architecture utilized Superset for:
- Dataset registration and management
- SQL query execution and caching
- Dynamic data visualization generation
- API endpoints for dashboard consumption

This architecture required maintaining both a Superset instance and the dashboard frontend, creating additional complexity and dependencies.

### 1.2 New Architecture

The new architecture uses:
- Pre-generated static JSON files for all datasets
- Azure Blob Storage for hosting data files
- Azure Static Web App for hosting the dashboard
- Client-side JavaScript for handling filtering and visualization
- GitHub Actions for automated dataset generation and deployment

This approach simplifies deployment, reduces dependencies, and improves performance by moving filtering and visualization logic to the client.

## 2. Migrated Components

### 2.1 Datasets

| Former Superset View | Replacement | Storage Location |
|----------------------|-------------|------------------|
| `vw_brand_mentions_by_geo` | `geo_brand_mentions.json` | `/assets/data/simulated/` |
| `vw_top_single_brands` | `top_brands.json` | `/assets/data/simulated/` |
| `vw_market_basket` | `geo_combo_frequency.json` | `/assets/data/simulated/` |
| `vw_store_performance_by_region` | `geo_sales_volume.json` | `/assets/data/simulated/` |
| `vw_store_density` | `geo_store_density.json` | `/assets/data/simulated/` |

### 2.2 Views and Queries

The SQL views and queries previously defined in Superset are now implemented as:
1. SQL stored procedures that generate the data
2. Python functions for data aggregation and transformation
3. JSON output formatting for direct consumption by the dashboard

### 2.3 Frontend Components

The dashboard frontend has been updated to:
- Load data from static JSON files or APIs
- Handle filtering in the browser
- Render visualizations client-side using Chart.js and Leaflet.js
- Support both real (API-based) and simulated (static file) data sources

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Data Export Script

A Python script (`export_datasets_to_json.py`) has been created to:
- Connect to the SQL database
- Execute stored procedures or SQL queries
- Transform the results into JSON format
- Export the JSON files to the local filesystem
- Upload the files to Azure Blob Storage

This script can run:
- On-demand for development purposes
- As a scheduled job via GitHub Actions
- With simulation mode to generate test data

### 3.2 JavaScript Integration

The dashboard JavaScript code has been updated to:
- Replace Superset API calls with JSON file loading
- Handle filtering and data processing client-side
- Update visualizations based on user interactions
- Provide a consistent data source toggle for testing

Key files modified:
- `medallion_data_connector.js`: Updated to support loading static JSON files
- `dashboard_integrator.js`: Enhanced to handle client-side filtering
- `choropleth_map.js`: Modified to work with the new GeoJSON data format

### 3.3 Azure Static Web App Configuration

The Azure Static Web App has been configured to:
- Serve static JSON data files with appropriate cache headers
- Support client-side routing for the single-page application
- Provide CORS headers for API access
- Optimize asset delivery via CDN

## 4. Automated Workflow

An automated workflow has been implemented using GitHub Actions:

1. **Data Generation**:
   - Scheduled daily runs or manual triggers
   - Connects to the production database (or generates simulated data)
   - Exports data to JSON format

2. **Blob Storage Upload**:
   - Uploads the JSON files to Azure Blob Storage
   - Sets appropriate cache headers
   - Ensures consistent file naming

3. **Dashboard Deployment**:
   - Deploys the updated dashboard to Azure Static Web App
   - Ensures all static assets are properly cached
   - Validates the deployment

## 5. Testing and Validation

The migration has been tested to ensure:

1. **Data Integrity**:
   - JSON data matches the previous Superset query results
   - Data structure is consistent and complete
   - Filtering produces the same results as before

2. **Performance**:
   - Page load times have been optimized
   - Filtering operations are responsive
   - Visualizations render efficiently

3. **Functionality**:
   - All dashboard features work as before
   - Filtering and interactivity are maintained
   - User experience remains consistent

## 6. Benefits of Migration

The migration from Superset to Static Azure Web App provides several benefits:

1. **Simplified Architecture**:
   - Elimination of Superset dependency
   - Reduced operational complexity
   - Fewer moving parts to maintain

2. **Improved Performance**:
   - Faster initial page load
   - Reduced server processing
   - Better caching of static assets

3. **Enhanced Deployment**:
   - Streamlined CI/CD process
   - Automated data updates
   - Easier version control

4. **Cost Reduction**:
   - Lower infrastructure costs
   - Reduced database query load
   - Pay-per-use pricing model

## 7. Future Enhancements

The new architecture enables several future enhancements:

1. **Offline Support**:
   - Implement service workers for offline access
   - Cache datasets for disconnected usage
   - Progressive Web App capabilities

2. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Add WebSocket support for live data updates
   - Implement incremental updates to reduce bandwidth
   - Provide real-time notifications

3. **Enhanced Filtering**:
   - Add advanced client-side filtering options
   - Implement cross-dataset filtering
   - Support complex query chains

## 8. Migration Tools

The following tools were created to facilitate the migration:

1. **Data Export Scripts**:
   - `export_datasets_to_json.py`: Exports SQL data to JSON
   - `sync_datasets_to_azure.sh`: Uploads JSON files to Azure Blob Storage

2. **JavaScript Updates**:
   - `update_superset_references.js`: Updates code references from Superset to static files
   - Patches to `medallion_data_connector.js` and `dashboard_integrator.js`

3. **Azure Configuration**:
   - `staticwebapp.config.json`: Configuration for Azure Static Web App
   - GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment

4. **SQL Procedures**:
   - `GetChoroplethData`: Stored procedure for generating GeoJSON data
   - Migration scripts for reference views

## 9. Conclusion

The migration from Superset to Static Azure Web App represents a significant improvement in the Scout Edge dashboard architecture. By leveraging static files for data and client-side processing for visualization, we've created a more robust, performant, and maintainable solution that meets all the requirements of the original Superset-based implementation.

The static architecture simplifies deployment, reduces dependencies, and improves the user experience while maintaining all the functionality of the original dashboard. The automated workflow ensures that data remains fresh and that deployments are consistent and reliable.

Moving forward, this architecture provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and features, allowing the Scout Edge dashboard to continue evolving to meet the needs of its users.
