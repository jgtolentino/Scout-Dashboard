# Prompt Engineering with Pulser

This document describes how to use Pulser's prompt engineering tools to analyze, improve, and generate variations of prompts.

## Overview

Pulser's prompt engineering tools leverage the collection of system prompts from various AI tools to help you create better prompts. The tools include:

1. **Prompt Analysis** - Analyze prompts for strengths and weaknesses
2. **Prompt Improvement** - Improve prompts based on specific goals
3. **Prompt Variations** - Generate variations of prompts for A/B testing

## Command Line Usage

### Analyzing Prompts

Analyze a prompt to identify its strengths, weaknesses, and potential improvements:

```bash
pulser prompt_engineer analyze --prompt "Write a blog post about AI."
```

Or analyze a prompt from a file:

```bash
pulser prompt_engineer analyze --file my_prompt.txt --output analysis.json
```

### Improving Prompts

Improve a prompt based on specific goals:

```bash
pulser prompt_engineer improve --prompt "Write code for a web server" --goals clarity,examples,specificity
```

Available improvement goals:
- `clarity` - Improve the clarity and simplicity of language
- `examples` - Add or improve examples
- `specificity` - Make the prompt more specific and precise

Save the improved prompt and a report:

```bash
pulser prompt_engineer improve --file my_prompt.txt --goals clarity,examples --output improved.txt --saveReport
```

### Generating Prompt Variations

Create multiple variations of a prompt for A/B testing:

```bash
pulser prompt_engineer variations --prompt "Explain quantum computing" --count 5
```

Save variations to a directory:

```bash
pulser prompt_engineer variations --file my_prompt.txt --count 3 --output ./variations
```

## API Usage

The prompt engineering features are also available via API endpoints:

### Analyze a Prompt

```http
POST /api/prompt_engineer/analyze
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "prompt": "Write a blog post about AI."
}
```

### Improve a Prompt

```http
POST /api/prompt_engineer/improve
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "prompt": "Write code for a web server",
  "goals": ["clarity", "examples", "specificity"]
}
```

### Generate Prompt Variations

```http
POST /api/prompt_engineer/variations
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "prompt": "Explain quantum computing",
  "count": 5
}
```

## Integration with System Prompts

The prompt engineering tools use the system prompts collection as examples. To ensure you have the latest prompts:

```bash
# Clone or update the system prompts repository
pulser system_prompts clone

# Index the prompts for faster searching
pulser system_prompts index

# Search for relevant prompts
pulser system_prompts search --query "coding" --tags agent,tool_use
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Analysis** - Analyze your prompt first to identify improvement areas
2. **Use Specific Goals** - Choose specific improvement goals rather than trying to improve everything at once
3. **Generate Variations** - Create multiple variations to test different approaches
4. **Reference Examples** - Look at system prompts from similar tools for inspiration
5. **Iterate** - Prompt engineering is an iterative process; test and refine

## Examples

### Example 1: Improving a Coding Prompt

```bash
# Original prompt: "Write a function to sort an array."

# Analyze the prompt
pulser prompt_engineer analyze --prompt "Write a function to sort an array."

# Improve the prompt
pulser prompt_engineer improve --prompt "Write a function to sort an array." --goals clarity,examples,specificity

# Result might be something like:
# "Write a JavaScript function that sorts an array of numbers in ascending order.
# The function should have a time complexity better than O(nÂ²).
# 
# Example input: [5, 3, 8, 1, 2, 9]
# Example output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]
# 
# Please include comments explaining your approach."
```

### Example 2: A/B Testing Variations

```bash
# Generate variations of a product description prompt
pulser prompt_engineer variations --prompt "Write a product description for a smartwatch" --count 3 --output ./product_prompts

# Test each variation with your LLM and compare results
```

## Future Enhancements

Future versions will include:
- Integration with Claude or other LLMs for deeper prompt analysis
- Prompt templates library
- Prompt effectiveness scoring based on response quality
- Collaborative prompt improvement workflows
