## Pre-Deployment Preparation

- [ ] Verify that the Azure CLI is installed (optional, for direct Azure deployment)

## Verification Steps

- [ ] Verify the deployment package exists
  ```bash
  ls -la deploy_v2.4.0/
  ```

- [ ] Run the verification script to ensure all required files are present
  ```bash
  ./verify_v2.4.0_deployment.sh
  ```

- [ ] Review the verification report for any warnings or errors
  ```bash
  open verification_report_*.html  # macOS
  # or
  xdg-open verification_report_*.html  # Linux
  ```

  ```

- [ ] Check that the deployment script has executable permissions
  ```bash
  ls -la deploy_v2.4.0.sh
  # If needed: chmod +x deploy_v2.4.0.sh
  ```

## Deployment Steps

- [ ] Ensure you have sufficient disk space for the deployment
  ```bash
  df -h
  ```

- [ ] Create a deployment log directory if it doesn't exist
  ```bash
  mkdir -p logs
  ```

- [ ] Run the deployment script
  ```bash
  ./deploy_v2.4.0.sh
  ```

- [ ] Monitor the deployment process
  ```bash
  tail -f logs/deployment_*.log
  ```

- [ ] Verify that the deployment completed successfully by checking for the success message

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Access the deployed dashboard in a web browser to verify it loads properly
  ```
  https://client360-dashboard.azurestaticapps.net/
  ```

- [ ] Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- [ ] Verify that all new features are functioning correctly:
  - [ ] Test Multi-Model AI features

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

If you encounter critical issues after deployment, follow these steps to rollback:

1. Identify the backup directory from the deployment log
   ```bash
   grep "backup" logs/deployment_*.log
   ```

2. Restore from the backup
   ```bash
   cp -r deploy_backups/client360_*/* deploy/
   ```

3. If deployed to Azure, redeploy the previous version
   ```bash
   az staticwebapp deploy \
     --name "client360-dashboard" \
     --source "deploy" \
     --api-location "" \
     --verbose
   ```

4. Notify users that the system has been rolled back
