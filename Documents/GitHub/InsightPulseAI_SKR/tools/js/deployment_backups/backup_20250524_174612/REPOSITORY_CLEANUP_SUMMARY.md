```

### Option 2: Manual Commands
```bash
# View the commands
./quick_branch_cleanup.sh

# Then copy-paste the displayed commands
```

### Option 3: GitHub Web UI
1. Go to https://github.com/tbwa-smp/project-scout/branches
2. Click the trash icon next to each branch to delete
3. Confirm each deletion

## Verification Steps

After cleanup, verify the results:

```bash
# Check remaining branches
git branch -a

# Verify main contains all features
git log --oneline main | head -10

# Check for clean commit history
git log --graph --oneline main
```

## Next Steps After Cleanup

### 1. Tag the Release
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Client360 Dashboard v1.0.0 Release

Features:
- Consumer Behavior Analysis
- Customer Profiling
- Transaction Trends & Heatmaps
- Geographic Visualization
- Whitelabeled for client delivery"

git push origin v1.0.0
```

### 2. Create Release Notes
Document the v1.0 features and capabilities for client presentation.

### 3. Deploy Production
Use the whitelabeled deployment package for client environments.

### 4. Enable Branch Protection
Set up GitHub branch protection rules on the main branch.

## Rollback Plan

If you need to recover deleted branches:

```bash
# Find deleted branch commits
git reflog

# Recreate a branch from commit hash
git checkout -b recovered-branch <commit-hash>
```

## Ongoing Maintenance

The implemented branch policy includes:
- Weekly automated cleanup
- Branch naming validation  
- Stale branch detection
- Client readiness monitoring

## Success Metrics

After cleanup, the repository will have:
- ✅ < 5 total branches
- ✅ 100% compliant branch names
- ✅ Zero internal branding in main
- ✅ Professional commit history
- ✅ Client-ready v1.0 release
