## 🔍 Configuration Details

```yaml
pulser_api:
  host: "http://localhost:8080"
  token: "new-test-token"
```

## 📋 Execution Results

1. **Setup Script Execution**:
   - Successfully ran `setup_mcp_claude_integration.sh`
   - MCP daemon started on port 9315
   - Configuration file created

2. **Status Check**:
   - MCP is running with PID 96266
   - Configuration file is valid
   - Health endpoint is reachable
   - API properly responds to health checks

3. **Log Analysis**:
   - Logs indicate the health endpoint is being accessed
   - No error messages observed

## 🚦 Connection Readiness

The MCP daemon is successfully running and the API is responding correctly. Claude Desktop should now be able to connect to the MCP daemon using the following settings:

- **MCP Host**: `http://127.0.0.1:9315` 
- **Authentication**: Using token from config

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. Configure Claude Desktop with the MCP host URL
2. Restart Claude Desktop to apply changes
3. Test the integration by attempting tool access from Claude Desktop

## ⚠️ Potential Issues

- The system is running Python 3.9.6, but MCP may require Python 3.12+
- If connection issues occur, check the troubleshooting guide
