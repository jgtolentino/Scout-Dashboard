# Scout Dashboard Rollback Summary

## Problem
The Scout Advisor dashboard lost its styling after a recent update, particularly affecting the Simulated/Real-time data source toggle and other UI elements.

## Solution
We performed a rollback to a known working version of the dashboard from commit `e5a75c8` ("Add complete CI/CD setup guide") which contained properly styled dashboard files. We also fixed issues with the TBWA theme and rollback component styles to ensure future deployments retain proper styling.

## Steps Taken
1. Created a new branch `rollback-dashboard-2025-05-19` for the rollback operation
2. Checked out commit `e5a75c8` to access the working version of the dashboard
3. Verified the dashboard files in this version, confirming proper styling elements
4. Created a Git tag `golden-20250519` pointing to this working version for future reference
5. Packaged the working dashboard files from the `deploy-advisor-fixed` directory
6. Deployed the package to Azure Static Web App using SWA CLI:
   ```bash
   swa deploy deploy_temp --env production --deployment-token "<TOKEN>"
   ```
7. Verified the dashboard was successfully restored with proper styling at:
   https://delightful-glacier-03349aa0f.6.azurestaticapps.net/advisor
8. Fixed TBWA theme issues with missing rollback component styles
9. Enhanced deployment scripts with better verification and fallback mechanisms
10. Created utility scripts to ensure rollback component consistency across themes

## Current State
- The dashboard is now fully styled and functional
- Data source indicates "Simulated Real-time" as expected
- All dashboard components (cards, charts, insights) render correctly
- TBWA theme includes proper rollback component styles
- Deployment scripts verify and fix styling issues automatically

## Enhanced Rollback System
We've significantly improved the rollback system with the following components:

### 1. Golden Baselines
- **Creation**: Generated using `create-golden-baseline.sh`
- **Storage**: Stored as Git tags with metadata in `.golden-baselines/` directory
- **Naming**: Uses format `golden-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` for unique identification

### 2. Rollback Mechanism
- **Initiation**: Executed via `rollback-to-golden.sh [GOLDEN_TAG]`
- **Methods**:
  - Git-based rollback (default)
  - Docker image rollback (if available)
  - Snapshot-based rollback (if available)
- **Verification**: Automatically verifies rollback with `verify-against-golden.sh`

### 3. UI Components
- **Rollback Dashboard**: Component showing current version and rollback options
- **Version Display**: Shows deployed version and available golden baselines
- **Action Buttons**: Provides rollback and verification actions

### 4. Theme Integration
The dashboard rollback system now works with all themes, with particular attention to the TBWA theme:

1. All themes include the rollback component styles
2. Theme variables include rollback-specific variables
3. Deployment scripts verify rollback styles exist in compiled CSS
4. Fallback mechanisms are in place to guarantee rollback UI functionality

## Workflow Examples

### Creating a Golden Baseline
```bash
./scripts/create-golden-baseline.sh --prefix golden --message "Release v2.3.0 baseline"
```

### Rolling Back to a Baseline
```bash
./scripts/rollback-to-golden.sh golden-20250519201210 --branch rollback-to-v2.3.0
```

### Verifying a Deployment
```bash
./scripts/verify-against-golden.sh --output verification-report.md
```

### Ensuring Rollback Components in Themes
```bash
./ensure_rollback_components.sh
```

## Recommendations for Preventing Future Issues
1. **Create Golden Baselines**: 
   - Use `scripts/create-golden-baseline.sh` to create official golden snapshots after successful deployments
   - Tag these with `golden-YYYYMMDD` for easy reference

2. **Pre-Deployment Verification**:
   - Add a pre-deployment verification step to ensure styling remains intact
   - Use `scripts/verify-against-golden.sh` to compare changes against known good versions

3. **Styling Fixes**:
   - Run `ensure_rollback_components.sh` before deployment to ensure all themes have proper styles
   - Test themes with `test_theme_fix.sh` to verify rollback component styling

4. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md with verification steps
   - Document key UI components that should be verified after deployments

## Next Steps
- Investigate and fix the root cause of the styling issues in the latest version
- Consider implementing a visual regression testing system to catch styling issues before they reach production
- Update the CI/CD pipeline to include verification against golden baselines
- Add automated theme testing to prevent styling inconsistencies
