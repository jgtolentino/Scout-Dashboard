## üöÄ How to Use The New Unified Scripts

### Option 1: Unified Bash Script (Linux/macOS)

The new unified Bash script provides the most comprehensive, safe approach to remediation:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x azure-advisor-remediation-unified.sh

# Show help
./azure-advisor-remediation-unified.sh --help

# Run in simulation mode (default) for security recommendations
./azure-advisor-remediation-unified.sh --fix-security

# Apply security fixes (use with caution)
./azure-advisor-remediation-unified.sh --fix-security --apply

# Apply all fixes (use with extreme caution)
./azure-advisor-remediation-unified.sh --fix-all --apply
```

**Parameters:**
- `--help` - Show usage information
- `--subscription NAME` - Azure subscription name (default: TBWA-ProjectScout-Prod)
- `--apply` - Apply changes (default mode is simulation)
- `--fix-cost` - Fix cost recommendations
- `--fix-security` - Fix security recommendations
- `--fix-reliability` - Fix reliability recommendations
- `--fix-all` - Fix all recommendations

### Option 2: Unified PowerShell Script (Windows)

The new unified PowerShell script provides the same functionality but for Windows environments:

```powershell
# Show help
./azure-advisor-remediation-unified.ps1 -Help

# Run in simulation mode (default) for security recommendations
./azure-advisor-remediation-unified.ps1 -FixSecurity

# Apply security fixes (use with caution)
./azure-advisor-remediation-unified.ps1 -FixSecurity -Apply

# Apply all fixes (use with extreme caution)
./azure-advisor-remediation-unified.ps1 -FixAll -Apply
```

**Parameters:**
- `-Help` - Show usage information
- `-SubscriptionName NAME` - Azure subscription name (default: TBWA-ProjectScout-Prod)
- `-Apply` - Apply changes (default mode is simulation)
- `-FixCost` - Fix cost recommendations
- `-FixSecurity` - Fix security recommendations
- `-FixReliability` - Fix reliability recommendations
- `-FixAll` - Fix all recommendations

### Option 3: Original CLI-based Remediation

Our previous script is still available:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x fix-azure-advisor-cli-fixed.sh

# Run in simulation mode (no changes applied)
./fix-azure-advisor-cli-fixed.sh --fix-all

# Apply security fixes only
./fix-azure-advisor-cli-fixed.sh --fix-security --whatif false

# Apply all fixes
./fix-azure-advisor-cli-fixed.sh --fix-all --whatif false
```

### Option 4: Analysis Only Scripts

To analyze the issues without making changes:

**Bash:**
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x azure-advisor-remediation.sh

# Run the script
./azure-advisor-remediation.sh
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Run the script
./azure-advisor-powershell.ps1
```

### Option 5: PowerShell Direct Fixes

To apply fixes directly using PowerShell (use with caution):

```powershell
# Test mode (no changes made)
./azure-advisor-direct-fixes.ps1 -WhatIf -FixAll

# Apply fixes for specific categories
./azure-advisor-direct-fixes.ps1 -FixCost
./azure-advisor-direct-fixes.ps1 -FixSecurity
./azure-advisor-direct-fixes.ps1 -FixReliability

# Apply all fixes
./azure-advisor-direct-fixes.ps1 -FixAll
```

## üìù Automated Fixes by Category

2. Check the remediation report directory for detailed logs
3. Monitor score changes in each category
4. Address any remaining recommendations
5. Document the changes made

## üìà Regular Maintenance

To ensure continued optimization:

1. Schedule monthly execution of the remediation script
2. Set up Azure Advisor notifications

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Always use `--whatif true` first to simulate changes
- Test in non-production environments before applying to production
- Take snapshots or backups before making significant changes
- Some recommendations require downtime (e.g., VM resizing)
- Schedule changes during maintenance windows
- Document all changes for future reference
