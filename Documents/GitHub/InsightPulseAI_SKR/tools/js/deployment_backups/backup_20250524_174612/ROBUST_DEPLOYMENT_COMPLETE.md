## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### Full Production Deployment
```bash
make deploy-full
# Runs: preflight → backup → deploy → verify
```

### Quick Deployment (Skip Some Checks)
```bash
make deploy-quick
```

### Manual Step-by-Step
```bash
make preflight    # Check prerequisites
make backup       # Create backup
make deploy       # Deploy to production
make verify       # Verify deployment health
```

### Emergency Procedures
```bash
make rollback           # Rollback to previous deployment
make emergency-stop     # Emergency deployment halt
make status            # Check current status
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
make dev-setup    # Setup development environment
make dev          # Start development server
make build        # Build for production
make test         # Run tests
```

## 🔐 Security Features
