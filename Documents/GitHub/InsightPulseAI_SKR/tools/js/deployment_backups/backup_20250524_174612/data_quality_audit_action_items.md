- [ ] Create quality trend dashboards
- [ ] Set up automated alerts for score degradation

**Owner:** Data Governance

### 6. Multimodal Data Alignment
**Finding:** Audio and visual data timestamps often misaligned  
**Impact:** Cannot correlate voice analytics with visual behavior  
**Action Items:**
- [ ] Implement NTP time sync on all edge devices
- [ ] Create timestamp reconciliation algorithm
- [ ] Add drift detection and correction
- [ ] Monitor alignment metrics in silver layer

**Owner:** IoT Team + Data Engineering  
**Timeline:** 3 weeks  
**Success Metric:** <100ms average timestamp drift

## ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Action Within 60 Days

### 7. End-to-End Trace ID Implementation
**Finding:** Cannot track data lineage from edge to gold layer  
**Impact:** Difficult to debug issues or audit data flow  
**Action Items:**
- [ ] Generate unique trace IDs at edge devices
- [ ] Propagate trace IDs through all pipeline stages
- [ ] Create trace ID lookup interface
- [ ] Add trace ID to all error logs

**Owner:** Platform Team  
**Timeline:** 6 weeks  
**Success Metric:** 100% of events traceable end-to-end

### 8. Automated Data Quality Remediation
**Finding:** All quality issues require manual intervention  
**Impact:** Slow response time, inconsistent fixes  
**Action Items:**
- [ ] Build automated retry mechanism for failed ingestions
- [ ] Create self-healing pipeline for common issues
- [ ] Implement automated data backfill processes
- [ ] Deploy quality issue classification system

**Owner:** Data Engineering  
**Timeline:** 8 weeks  
**Success Metric:** 80% of issues auto-remediated

### 9. Real-time Quality Dashboards
**Finding:** No real-time visibility into data quality metrics  
**Impact:** Quality issues discovered too late  
**Action Items:**
- [ ] Build real-time quality monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Add drill-down capabilities by store/device/region
- [ ] Create mobile app for field technicians
- [ ] Implement push notifications for critical issues

**Owner:** BI Team  
**Timeline:** 6 weeks  
**Success Metric:** <5 minute latency for quality metrics
