## 6. Next Steps for Completion

1. **Update QA Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   # Apply GenAI insights quality section to QA dashboard
   ./update_qa_dashboard_with_genai.sh
   ```

2. **Update Retail Performance Dashboard**:
   ```bash
   # Add GenAI insights to retail dashboard
   ./add_genai_to_retail_dashboard.sh

5. **Deploy to Azure**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy all dashboards to Azure
   ./setup_azure_resources_custom.sh
   ./deploy_dashboard.sh
   ```

## 7. Final Verification

Before production push:

```bash
# Run full verification
./verify_implementation.sh

# Check white-labeling consistency
./verify_commit_readiness.sh
```

## Conclusion

The GenAI insights core implementation is complete, but full integration across all dashboards needs additional work to ensure consistency in styling, behavior, and data connections. The Azure deployment is ready but pending final verification with actual resources.
