# Medallion Architecture Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Current Status

After reviewing the existing scripts and artifacts in the medallion_enhancements directory, it appears that individual components of the Medallion Architecture enhancement plan have been developed, but the full implementation may not have been completed using the master deployment script (`6_deploy_medallion_enhancements.sh`).

The following artifacts indicate partial execution of enhancement scripts:
- `lifecycle_policy.json` - Used by the Storage Lifecycle Management script
- `inventory_policy.json` - Used by the Storage Lifecycle Management script
- `storage_dashboard_template.json` - Used by the Storage Lifecycle Management script

No final `MEDALLION_ENHANCED_ARCHITECTURE.md` documentation was found, which suggests the full deployment process was not completed.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Environment Preparation and Validation

1. Ensure all prerequisites are met:
   - Azure CLI is installed and logged in
   - Databricks CLI is installed
   - Python 3.x is installed (for the Data Quality Framework)
   - Valid Azure credentials with appropriate permissions

2. Verify existing Azure resources:
   ```bash
   # Verify resource group exists
   az group show --name RG-TBWA-ProjectScout-Juicer
   
   # Verify Databricks workspace
   az databricks workspace show --name tbwa-juicer-databricks --resource-group RG-TBWA-ProjectScout-Juicer
   
   # Verify storage account
   az storage account show --name tbwajuicerstorage --resource-group RG-TBWA-ProjectScout-Juicer
   
   # Verify Key Vault
   az keyvault show --name kv-tbwa-juicer-insights2 --resource-group RG-TBWA-ProjectScout-Juicer
   ```

### Step 2: Full Deployment

Execute the master deployment script which will run all enhancement components in sequence:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x 6_deploy_medallion_enhancements.sh

# Execute the script
./6_deploy_medallion_enhancements.sh
```

This script will:
1. Verify all dependencies
2. Guide through the deployment process interactively
3. Create compute isolation for each medallion layer
4. Implement data quality checks between layers
5. Set up monitoring and alerts
6. Configure storage lifecycle management
7. Enhance security with VNet integration and key rotation
8. Generate documentation

### Step 3: Individual Component Deployment (Alternative Approach)

If you encounter issues with the master script, you can run each enhancement component individually:

1. **Compute Isolation**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x 1_compute_isolation.sh
   ./1_compute_isolation.sh
   ```

2. **Data Quality Framework**:
   ```bash
   python3 2_data_quality_framework.py --workspace-url <databricks-url> --bronze-job-id <job-id> --silver-job-id <job-id> --gold-job-id <job-id> --platinum-job-id <job-id>
   ```
   
   You'll need the following information:
   - Databricks workspace URL (e.g., adb-1234567890123456.16.azuredatabricks.net)
   - Job IDs for each medallion layer (bronze, silver, gold, platinum)

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x 3_monitoring_alerting.sh
   ./3_monitoring_alerting.sh
   ```

4. **Storage Lifecycle Management**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x 4_storage_lifecycle_management.sh
   ./4_storage_lifecycle_management.sh
   ```

5. **Security Enhancements** (Note: this involves network changes that may temporarily disrupt connectivity):
   ```bash
   chmod +x 5_security_enhancements.sh
   ./5_security_enhancements.sh
   ```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify that all components were successfully implemented:

1. **Compute Clusters**: Verify in Databricks that dedicated clusters for each medallion layer were created:
   - BronzeLayerProcessing
   - SilverLayerProcessing
   - GoldPlatinumLayerProcessing

2. **Data Quality**: Verify that data quality notebooks were created in Databricks:
   - /Shared/InsightPulseAI/Juicer/data_quality/bronze_quality
   - /Shared/InsightPulseAI/Juicer/data_quality/silver_quality
   - /Shared/InsightPulseAI/Juicer/data_quality/gold_quality
   - /Shared/InsightPulseAI/Juicer/data_quality/platinum_quality

3. **Monitoring & Alerts**: Verify in Azure Portal:
   - Log Analytics workspace "juicer-log-analytics" exists
   - Action group "juicer-alerts-action-group" exists
   - Diagnostic settings are configured for all resources
   - Alerts are configured (Storage capacity, Databricks job failures, etc.)
   - Dashboard "juicer-insights-monitoring-dashboard" exists

4. **Storage Lifecycle**: Verify in Azure Portal:
   - Lifecycle management policy is applied to storage account
   - Soft delete is enabled for blobs and containers
   - Dashboard "juicer-storage-lifecycle-dashboard" exists

5. **Security Enhancements**: Verify in Azure Portal:
   - Virtual Network "juicer-vnet" exists with all subnets
   - Private endpoints are created for Storage and Key Vault
   - Network rules are restricting access appropriately
   - Automation account "juicer-key-rotation" exists with scheduled job

### Step 5: Documentation

After successful deployment, the master script should generate comprehensive documentation. If this didn't happen, you can manually create it:

```bash
# Master script will generate this file
./6_deploy_medallion_enhancements.sh > deployment_log.txt

# The documentation will be generated as
cat MEDALLION_ENHANCED_ARCHITECTURE.md
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. **Azure Resource Conflicts**: Check if resources with the same names already exist
   ```bash
   az resource list --resource-group RG-TBWA-ProjectScout-Juicer
   ```

2. **Permission Issues**: Ensure you have sufficient permissions for all operations
   ```bash
   az role assignment list --assignee <your-email>
   ```

3. **Databricks API Issues**: Verify Databricks token and workspace URL
   ```bash
   # Test Databricks CLI connectivity
   databricks workspace ls
   ```

4. **Network Disruptions**: If network connectivity is disrupted after running security enhancements, you may need to add additional IP allowlists
   ```bash
   # Add your current IP to storage firewall
   MY_IP=$(curl -s https://api.ipify.org)
   az storage account network-rule add --resource-group RG-TBWA-ProjectScout-Juicer --account-name tbwajuicerstorage --ip-address $MY_IP
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Run the master deployment script or individual component scripts as needed
2. Verify all resources were created correctly
3. Integrate the enhanced architecture with existing Juicer workloads
4. Schedule recurring reviews of lifecycle policies, monitoring alerts, and security configurations
5. Document any custom modifications made during the implementation process
