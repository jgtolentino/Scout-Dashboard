# White-Labeling Implementation

This document outlines the steps taken to white-label the dashboard hub and ensure no internal references to "Pulser" or "InsightPulseAI" appear in customer-facing interfaces.

## Changes Applied

### Main Dashboard Hub (index.html)
- Changed page title from "InsightPulseAI Dashboards" to "Retail Advisor Dashboards"
- Updated header text and alt tags from "InsightPulseAI" to "Retail Advisor"
- Changed footer copyright from "© 2025 InsightPulseAI" to "© 2025 Retail Advisor"
- Replaced "Powered by Pulser" with "Powered by Analytics" in footer badge
- Updated CSS class names from `pulser-badge` and `pulser-version` to `analytics-badge` and `analytics-version`

### JavaScript Files
- Renamed `/js/pulser-sunnies-integration.js` to `/js/analytics-quality-integration.js`
- Updated internal references from "Pulser" to "Analytics" within the JavaScript code

### Deployment Script
- Updated the deployment script to handle the renamed JavaScript file
- Added metadata to the script header to indicate it has been white-labeled

## Testing

After implementing these changes, the dashboard has been deployed to Azure Blob Storage and verified to ensure no references to "Pulser" or "InsightPulseAI" appear in the user interface.

## Deployment

To deploy the white-labeled dashboard, use the following command:

```bash
./deploy_retail_dashboard.sh
```

By default, this will deploy to the Azure Storage Account specified in the script configuration.

## Additional Notes

The white-labeling process maintains full functionality while removing internal references. Future deployments should continue to use this white-labeled version as the base to avoid accidentally reintroducing internal product names.
