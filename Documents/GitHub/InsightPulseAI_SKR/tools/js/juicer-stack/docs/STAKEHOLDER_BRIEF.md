## Executive Summary

The Juicer GenAI Insights system has been successfully deployed to Azure. This system provides automated generation of actionable insights from brand conversation transcripts using advanced AI processing. The solution is now operational with all infrastructure provisioned and ready for production use.

## Business Value

- **Automated Insight Extraction:** Converts raw conversation data into actionable business insights without manual analysis
- **Brand Sentiment Tracking:** Real-time monitoring of brand perception and sentiment across customer interactions
- **Multi-model AI Resilience:** Uses multiple AI models (Claude, OpenAI, DeepSeek) with automatic fallback for uninterrupted service
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Provides stakeholders with intuitive dashboard access to insights
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built on Azure Databricks for enterprise-grade performance and scalability

## Technical Components

### Azure Resources (Deployed)

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Databricks Workspace | Data processing and AI model execution |
| Storage Account | Data lake for Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum data layers |
| Static Web App | Hosts the interactive dashboard |
| Key Vault | Secure storage for API keys and credentials |

### Data Architecture

The system implements an extended Medallion architecture:

1. **Bronze Layer:** Raw transcript data from source systems
2. **Silver Layer:** Enriched data with brand mentions and sentiment
3. **Gold Layer:** Analysis-ready reconstructed transcripts
4. **Platinum Layer:** GenAI-generated insights with confidence scoring

### Analytics Process Flow

```
Input Sources → Transcript Processing → Brand Detection → AI Insight Generation → Interactive Dashboard
                                                                             ↓
                                                           QA & Confidence Scoring
```

## Featured Capabilities

1. **Multi-model AI Processing:**
   - Automated fallback between Claude, OpenAI, and DeepSeek models
   - Confidence scoring to identify high-quality insights
   - Continuous monitoring for hallucination detection

2. **Interactive Insights Dashboard:**
