## Changes Made

### 1. System Architecture & QA Dashboard (Main)

This dashboard now focuses exclusively on system architecture and QA metrics:

- **System Health Monitoring**: Shows KPIs aligned with Azure Well-Architected Framework
  - Model Reliability: 96.2%
  - Data Health: 94.8%
  - Infrastructure Uptime: 99.7%
  - Overall Health: 97.1%

- **Device Monitoring**: For edge/IoT device tracking
  - Total Devices: 156
  - Silent Devices: 3
  - Critical Alerts: 2
  - Data Quality: 98.7%

- **Anomaly Detection**: Added as requested
  - Drift Detection
  - Confidence Deviation
  - Outlier Rate

- **QA Dev Mode Toggle**: Added for QA testing and debugging

### 2. GenAI Insights Dashboard (Separate)

Created a separate dashboard focused on client-facing insights:

- Trending Tags
- Top Insights
- Brand Analysis
- Sentiment Analysis
- Actions & Recommendations

## Azure Well-Architected Framework Alignment

The System Architecture dashboard now aligns with Azure Well-Architected Framework principles:

- **Reliability**: Displayed via uptime metrics and silent device tracking
- **Security**: Implied through data quality and system health
- **Performance**: Tracked through model reliability metrics
- **Operational Excellence**: Supported by QA dev mode and anomaly detection

## Final Status

âœ… **Fully Deployed**: All dashboards are successfully deployed to Azure
âœ… **Well-Structured**: Clear separation of system architecture and client insights
âœ… **White-Labeled**: All references properly converted (Pulser â†’ OpsCore, etc.)
âœ… **Cross-Navigation**: Links between dashboards for easy navigation
