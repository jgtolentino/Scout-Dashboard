# Implementation Status: Medallion Architecture & Snow White Integration

## Azure Deployment Status

We have successfully implemented key components of the Databricks Medallion Azure Well-Architected Framework and created the Snow White agent for white-labeling. Here's the current status:

### ‚úÖ Completed Components

1. **Core Medallion Architecture Framework**
   - Identified alignment gaps with the Well-Architected Framework
   - Created detailed implementation plan with phased approach
   - Developed scripts for all enhancement areas

2. **Storage Lifecycle Management**
   - Implemented tiered storage strategy for each medallion layer
   - Configured retention policies based on data age and importance:
     - Bronze: Hot ‚Üí Cool (30 days) ‚Üí Archive (90 days)
     - Silver: Hot ‚Üí Cool (60 days) ‚Üí Archive (180 days)
     - Gold: Hot ‚Üí Cool (90 days)
     - Platinum: 2-year retention policy
   - Logs/Temp: Archive (30 days) ‚Üí Delete (365 days)
   - Snapshots: Delete after 90 days
   - Created inventory container for tracking

3. **Monitoring Foundation**
   - Created Log Analytics workspace for centralized logging
   - Configured initial diagnostic settings
   - Established basic monitoring framework

4. **Snow White Agent**
   - Developed agent configuration (`snowwhite.yaml`)
   - Created JavaScript implementation (`snowwhite_agent.js`)
   - Built CLI interface (`snowwhite_cli.js`)
   - Set up alias mappings for white-labeling
   - Configured license and notice files
   - Added documentation for agent integration

### üîÑ Partially Completed

1. **Compute Isolation**
   - Script created for dedicated Databricks clusters
   - Pending Databricks token for execution
   - Cluster configurations optimized for each layer

2. **Data Quality Framework**
   - Python implementation ready
   - Great Expectations framework configured
   - Data quality metrics defined for each layer
   - Pending Databricks workspace integration

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Security enhancement script created
   - Pending Azure environment compatibility checks
   - Key rotation mechanism defined

### ‚ùå Known Issues

1. **Monitoring Alert Configuration**
   - Action Group creation syntax needs updates for newer Azure CLI
   - Dashboard creation requires specific permissions

2. **Databricks Integration Dependencies**
   - Databricks token required for notebook and job setup
   - Interactive approval needed for workspace modifications

3. **Snow White CLI Commands**
   - Fixed parameter conflict in aliasmap edit command
   - May require additional NPM dependencies for full operation

## Deployment Instructions

### For Immediate Use - Working Components

#### 1. Storage Lifecycle Management
```bash
cd medallion_enhancements
./4_storage_lifecycle_management.sh
```

#### 2. Snow White White-Labeling
```bash
cd ..
node scripts/snowwhite_cli.js preview --file README.md
node scripts/snowwhite_cli.js whitelabel --client "ProjectScout" --source ./docs --output ./client-facing/docs
```

### For Full Deployment

1. Review the full implementation plan in `MEDALLION_PLAN_WITH_SNOW_WHITE.md`
2. Generate a Databricks token from the workspace
3. Run individual enhancement scripts in sequence
4. Verify each component after deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Near-Term**:
   - Fix monitoring script to accommodate Azure CLI syntax
   - Obtain Databricks token for cluster setup
   - Complete individual script testing

2. **Medium-Term**:
   - Deploy full medallion architecture
   - Implement data quality checks
   - Integrate white-labeling into CI/CD pipeline

3. **Long-Term**:
   - Complete security enhancements
   - Set up comprehensive monitoring
   - Automate white-labeling for all client deliverables
