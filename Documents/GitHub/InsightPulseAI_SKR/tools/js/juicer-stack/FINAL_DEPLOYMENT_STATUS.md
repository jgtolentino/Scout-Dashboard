# Final Deployment Status - System Architecture & QA Dashboard

## Overview

This document provides the final status of the System Architecture & QA Dashboard deployment for Project Scout. The deployment includes a refactored main dashboard with focus on system architecture monitoring and QA metrics with cross-navigation to other specialized dashboards.

## Deployment Architecture

- **Main Dashboard**: System Architecture & QA Dashboard (`/index.html`)
- **Insights Dashboard**: Client-facing insights view (`/insights_dashboard.html`)
- **Retail Edge Dashboard**: Specialized dashboard for retail metrics (`/retail_edge/retail_edge_dashboard.html`)
- **Operations Dashboard**: Specialized dashboard for operations metrics (`/ops/system_dashboard.html`)

## Deployment URLs

- **Production URL**: [https://tbwa-juicer-insights-dashboard.azurewebsites.net](https://tbwa-juicer-insights-dashboard.azurewebsites.net)
- **Resource Group**: `RG-TBWA-ProjectScout-Juicer`
- **Static Web App Name**: `tbwa-juicer-insights-dashboard`

## System Architecture & QA Dashboard Features

The main dashboard has been completely refactored to focus on system architecture monitoring and QA. Key features include:

### Visible by Default
- **System Health Monitoring**: Model Reliability, Data Health, Infrastructure Uptime, API Performance
- **Device Monitoring**: Total Devices, Silent Devices, Critical Alerts, Device Health Metrics
- **Anomaly Detection**: Model Drift Status, Confidence Deviation, Outlier Rate

### Visible in QA Mode Only (Toggle Button)
- **System Activity Timeline**: Recent deployments, backups, and system events
- **Azure Well-Architected Metrics**: Reliability, Security, Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency
- **Service Health Status Table**: Detailed status of all system components

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Refactored main dashboard to focus on System Architecture & QA metrics
2. ✅ Removed client-facing elements from main dashboard
3. ✅ Added System Health Monitoring components
4. ✅ Added Device Monitoring section
5. ✅ Added Anomaly Detection section
6. ✅ Implemented QA Developer Mode toggle
7. ✅ Added hidden sections that appear when QA Mode is activated
8. ✅ Set up cross-navigation between dashboards
9. ✅ White-labeled all references (Pulser → OpsCore, Juicer → Retail Advisor)
10. ✅ Deployed all dashboards to Azure Static Web App
11. ✅ Fixed deployment issues with artifact folder paths

## Deployment Method

Used a custom deployment approach that:
1. Creates separate build and deployment directories
2. Resolves the "Current directory cannot be identical to or contained within artifact folders" error
3. Supports both `swa deploy` and `az staticwebapp deploy` methods
4. Maintains cross-navigation between dashboards

## Next Steps

1. Set up scheduled dashboard snapshots using GitHub Actions
2. Configure monitoring for dashboard availability
3. Implement automated testing for dashboard components
