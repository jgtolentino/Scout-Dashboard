# Retail Advisor Analytics Architecture

## Project Overview
The Retail Advisor Analytics platform is a data processing and insights engine designed to extract and analyze brand mentions from transcribed customer conversations, generate actionable insights using multiple AI providers, and visualize results through interactive dashboards.

## Architecture Components

1. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Follows a layered data architecture with 4 tiers:
     - Bronze: Raw data ingestion from transcripts
     - Silver: Enriched data with brand intelligence and sentiment
     - Gold: Analysis-ready data for insights
     - Platinum: AI-generated insights with confidence scoring

2. **Azure Resources**
   - Resource Group: `RG-Client-RetailAnalytics`
   - Storage Account with containers (bronze, silver, gold, platinum)
   - Databricks Workspace for data processing
   - Static Web App for dashboard hosting
   - Key Vault for secure credential management

3. **Processing Notebooks**
   - `retail_advisor_ingest_bronze.sql`: Ingests raw data into Bronze layer
   - `retail_advisor_enrich_silver.py`: Process Bronze data to extract brand intelligence
   - `retail_advisor_gold_insights.py`: Transforms Gold data into AI insights
   - `retail_advisor_setup_insights_tables.sql`: Creates Platinum layer schema
   - `retail_advisor_setup_storage.py`: Configures storage mounts

4. **Dashboard & Visualization**
   - Interactive web dashboard for exploring insights
   - Brand intelligence heatmaps and sentiment visualization
   - JavaScript libraries for dynamic chart rendering

5. **Integration with OpsCore CLI**
   - Configuration hooks for brand intelligence and insights
   - Natural language querying capability
   - Command-line tools for executing workflows

6. **Quality Assurance**
   - Visual validation for dashboard components
   - AI output validation with quality scoring
   - Confidence scoring for generated insights

## Deployment Process

The deployment is broken into three main stages:

1. **Azure Infrastructure Deployment**
   - Automated creation of all required Azure resources
   - Configuration of storage containers and access policies

2. **Databricks Resources Setup**
   - Cluster configuration and notebook deployment
   - Creation of scheduled jobs for insights generation

3. **Dashboard Deployment**
   - Deployment of visualization components to Static Web App

## Key Features and Capabilities

1. **Brand Intelligence Analysis**
   - Natural language querying: `retail-advisor query "Show brand mentions for brand XYZ last 7 days"`
   - Sentiment analysis and trend identification

2. **AI Insights Generation**
   - Multi-model support with fallback mechanisms
   - Confidence scoring and metadata enrichment
   - Automated insight categorization

3. **Visualization and Dashboards**
   - Interactive filtering and exploration
   - Sentiment heatmaps and trend visualization
   - Insights cards with confidence indicators

## Implementation Plan
