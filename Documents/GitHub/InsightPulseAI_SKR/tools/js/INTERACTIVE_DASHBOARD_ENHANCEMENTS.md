- Responsive design across all viewports

### 2. Cross-Filtering Capabilities
Added advanced cross-filtering functionality that allows:
- Clicking KPI cards to filter related charts and insights
- Clicking chart elements to filter other visualizations

Improved chart tooltips with:

### 4. Data Export Functionality
Added data export capabilities:
- Export to CSV for all charts and visualizations

4. The filter state is visually indicated throughout the dashboard

### Data Export
