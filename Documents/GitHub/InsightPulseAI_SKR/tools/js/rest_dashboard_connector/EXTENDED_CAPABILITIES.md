# Extended Capabilities Blueprint

This document outlines how to extend our proxy signals approach to include AR recommendations, automated reporting, and brand detection redeployment.

## 1. In-Store AR Recommendation System

### Architecture Overview

```
Computer Vision → Product Detection → Shelf Analytics → AR Overlay → Personalized Recommendations
```

### Components

1. **Mobile AR Application**
   - Built with ARKit (iOS) / ARCore (Android)
   - Camera feed processes real-time with on-device ML
   - Overlay UI shows product data, recommendations, and inventory status

2. **Product Recognition Model**
   - Lightweight MobileNet-based model for on-device detection
   - Recognizes brands, SKUs, and packaging variations 
   - 15-30 FPS performance on mid-range devices

3. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Real-time product recommendations based on:
     - Current shelf view (what's visible)
     - User preferences (if authenticated)
     - Current promotions and inventory status
     - Complementary product suggestions

4. **Implementation Path**

```javascript
// High-level AR implementation flow
const arRecommendationPipeline = [
  captureFrame,             // Get camera frame from AR session
  detectProducts,           // Run on-device ML for product detection
  queryInventoryStatus,     // Get proxy inventory data for detected products
  fetchRecommendations,     // Get personalized recommendations
  renderArOverlay,          // Display floating AR UI next to products
  trackUserInteractions     // Monitor which recommendations are effective
];
```

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Development App** (8 weeks)
   - Internal testing app with basic detection
   - AR marker-based for controlled testing
   - Focus on UX and core detection accuracy

2. **Phase 2: Field Agent Tool** (12 weeks)
   - Limited release to field agents
   - Add recommendation engine integration
   - Improve accuracy with field data collection

3. **Phase 3: Consumer Pilot** (16 weeks)
   - Limited customer release in test markets
   - Integration with loyalty program
   - A/B testing of recommendation algorithms

## 2. Automated Reporting & Notification System

### Report Types

1. **Store-Level Performance Reports**
   - Shelf share vs target (by category)
   - Competitor proximity analysis
   - Execution quality score
   - Heat map of brand visibility

2. **Regional Trend Reports**
   - Week-over-week shelf presence change
   - Competitor activity patterns
   - Promotion effectiveness
   - Social mention correlation

3. **Executive Dashboards**
   - Market-wide brand visibility
   - Share of shelf vs market share
   - Opportunity identification
   - ROI on merchandising initiatives

### Notification Framework

```javascript
// Notification rules engine (pseudocode)
const retailAlertRules = [
  {
    name: "critical-stock-alert",
    condition: store => store.availabilityScore < 25,
    recipients: ["store-manager", "supply-chain-team"],
    channels: ["email", "sms", "dashboard"],
    throttle: "1-per-day",
    template: "critical-stock-template",
    priority: "high"
  },
  {
    name: "competitor-activity-alert",
    condition: store => store.competitorChangeScore > 40,
    recipients: ["category-manager", "field-team"],
    channels: ["email", "dashboard"],
    throttle: "1-per-week",
    template: "competitor-alert-template",
    priority: "medium"
  },
  {
    name: "merchandising-opportunity",
    condition: store => 
      store.trafficScore > 70 && store.shelfShareScore < 40,
    recipients: ["merchandising-team"],
    channels: ["dashboard", "weekly-report"],
    throttle: "1-per-2-weeks",
    template: "opportunity-template",
    priority: "medium"
  }
];
```

### Delivery Channels

1. **Real-time Alerts**
   - Push notifications (mobile app)
   - SMS for critical issues
   - In-dashboard alert center

2. **Scheduled Reports**
   - Email delivery (PDF/HTML)
   - Dashboard refresh
   - PowerPoint generation for executive review

3. **Integration Points**
   - Teams channel posting
   - CRM ticket creation
   - Field team task assignment

### Implementation Architecture

```
Azure Functions (Timer) → Alert Engine → Template Renderer → Notification Gateway → Delivery Channels
```

## 3. Brand Detection Redeployment

### Current State Assessment

The current brand detection model is deployed on Azure ML but is no longer actively used. Options for redeployment:

### Option A: Migrate to Azure Cognitive Services

**Advantages:**
- Fully managed service
- Simpler deployment and scaling
- Lower operational overhead

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Export trained model from Azure ML
2. Convert to ONNX format if needed
3. Import to Custom Vision AI
4. Create prediction endpoint
5. Update API references in code

### Option B: Deploy as Container

**Advantages:**
- Portable across cloud providers
- Can run on-premises or at the edge
- Fine-grained control over resources

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Package model and inference code in container
2. Deploy to Azure Container Instances or AKS
3. Set up auto-scaling based on demand
4. Implement robust monitoring
5. Update API references in code

### Option C: Reimplement with Modern Architecture

**Advantages:**
- Take advantage of newer models
- Optimize for specific use cases
- Improve performance and accuracy

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Train new models on expanded dataset
2. Implement model ensemble approach
3. Deploy as serverless endpoints
4. Implement A/B testing infrastructure
5. Gradually transition traffic to new models

### Recommended Approach

**Hybrid Approach:**
1. Short-term: Option A (migrate to Cognitive Services)
2. Mid-term: Option C in parallel (train new models)
3. Long-term: Full transition to optimized models

This approach:
- Minimizes disruption to existing systems
- Provides immediate cost optimization
- Establishes path to improved performance

### Implementation Blueprint

```javascript
// Migration to Cognitive Services (pseudocode)
async function migrateBrandDetectionModel() {
  // 1. Export existing model from Azure ML
  const exportedModel = await azureML.exportModel(
    "brand-detection-model",
    { format: "ONNX" }
  );
  
  // 2. Create Custom Vision project
  const project = await customVision.createProject({
    name: "Retail Brand Detection",
    domain: "OBJECT_DETECTION",
    classification_type: "MULTICLASS"
  });
  
  // 3. Import model to Custom Vision
  await customVision.importModel(
    project.id,
    exportedModel.path
  );
  
  // 4. Publish prediction endpoint
  const endpoint = await customVision.publish(
    project.id,
    "production",
    "Brand Detection API"
  );
  
  // 5. Update configuration to use new endpoint
  await updateApiConfiguration(
    "brand-detection",
    endpoint.url,
    endpoint.key
  );
  
  // 6. Run validation tests
  const validationResults = await runValidationTests(
    "brand-detection",
    testCases
  );
  
  // 7. Update documentation
  await updateDocumentation(
    "brand-detection",
    endpoint,
    validationResults
  );
  
  return {
    success: validationResults.success,
    endpoint: endpoint.url,
    performance: validationResults.metrics
  };
}
```
