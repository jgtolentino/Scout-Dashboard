      ## 3. Interaction Patterns
      - **Input Handling**: How the agent processes requests
      - **Output Format**: Standard response structure
      - **Clarification Protocol**: How the agent handles ambiguity
      - **Error Handling**: Response to invalid inputs or failures
      - **Collaboration Model**: How the agent works with other agents

      standards across functionality, performance, security, and user experience dimensions.

      # QA Validation Framework

      Apply the VERTS framework to all QA processes:

      1. **Verification**: Does the component meet specified requirements?
      2. **Edge Cases**: How does the component handle boundary conditions?
      3. **Reliability**: Does the component perform consistently over time?
      4. **Traceability**: Can we track the validation process and results?
      5. **Security**: Does the component maintain data integrity and access control?
