      Human: Write a function to find duplicate values in an array.
      
      Claude: I'll write a function to find duplicate values in an array. Let me analyze the problem first:

      1. We need to identify elements that appear more than once
      2. We need to return only the duplicated values
      3. We should return each duplicate only once (not each occurrence)

      Here's an efficient implementation in JavaScript:

      ```javascript
      /**
       * Finds duplicate values in an array
       * @param {Array} array - The input array to check for duplicates
       * @return {Array} - Array containing only the duplicate values (each listed once)
       */
      function findDuplicates(array) {
        // Handle edge cases
        if (!array || array.length <= 1) {
          return [];
        }
        
        const seen = new Set();
        const duplicates = new Set();
        
        for (const item of array) {
          // If we've seen this item before, it's a duplicate
          if (seen.has(item)) {
            duplicates.add(item);
          } else {
            // Otherwise, add it to our set of seen items
            seen.add(item);
          }
        }
        
        // Convert Set to Array before returning
        return Array.from(duplicates);
      }
      
      // Example usage:
      // const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 3, 7];
      // console.log(findDuplicates(arr)); // Output: [2, 3]
      ```

      This solution has:
      - O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the array
      - O(n) space complexity in the worst case
      
      The function uses Sets for efficient lookups. It tracks items we've seen once, and when we encounter them again, adds them to our duplicates Set. By using Sets, we automatically handle the requirement to return each duplicate only once.

      Let me know if you'd like this implementation in a different language or if you have any questions about this approach!
