# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Fix Schema Sync Workflow Blocking Production

## Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow "Full-Stack Schema Sync Pipeline" is failing and blocking deployments because:
- It expects a Next.js App Router project structure
- It's looking for modules that don't exist in bolt-app-hack
- Build verification fails with TypeScript errors

## Immediate Fix Options

### Option 1: Disable the Workflow (Fastest)
Go to your GitHub repository settings:
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/jgtolentino/bolt-app-hack/actions
2. Find "Full-Stack Schema Sync Pipeline"
3. Click the "..." menu â†’ Disable workflow

### Option 2: Fix via GitHub Web UI
1. Go to: https://github.com/jgtolentino/bolt-app-hack
2. Navigate to `.github/workflows/`
3. Find the schema sync workflow file
4. Either:
   - Delete it entirely, OR
   - Rename it to `schema-sync.yml.disabled`, OR
   - Edit it to add this at the top:
   ```yaml
   on:
     workflow_dispatch:  # Only run manually, not on push
   ```

### Option 3: Create Missing Directories
Add these files to make the workflow pass:

**src/lib/supabase.ts:**
```typescript
export const supabase = {
  from: () => ({ select: () => Promise.resolve({ data: [], error: null }) })
}
```

**src/services/dataAlignment.ts:**
```typescript
export const alignData = (data: any) => data
```

**src/types/generated/index.ts:**
```typescript
export interface ComprehensiveTransaction {}
```

## Why This Happened
The schema-sync workflow was designed for a different project structure and is trying to generate API routes for a Next.js App Router application, but bolt-app-hack appears to use a different framework.

## Long-term Solution
Either:
1. Remove the schema-sync workflow entirely if not needed
2. Update it to work with your actual project structure
3. Replace it with a workflow appropriate for your tech stack
