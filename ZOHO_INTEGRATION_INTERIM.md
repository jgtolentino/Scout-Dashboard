# InsightPulseAI Zoho Integration: Interim Status

## üìä Current State of Integration

The Zoho Mail integration for InsightPulseAI is currently in a **partially operational** state. This document outlines what is working, what has limitations, and how to proceed with the available functionality.

### ‚úÖ Working Components

- **OAuth Authentication**: Successfully configured
- **Account Discovery**: API can identify and access account information
- **Folder Listing**: API can list mail folders
- **DNS Configuration**: All required DNS records properly configured
  - MX Records
  - SPF Record 
  - DKIM Record
  - Domain Verification

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited Components

- **Message Operations**: Creating and sending messages currently unavailable
- **Profile Access**: User profile information retrieval limited
- **From Addresses**: Email alias management limited
- **Draft Creation**: Email draft creation unavailable

## üîÑ Subscription Status

Your Zoho Workplace Standard Plan subscription has been successfully processed, but API access changes can take time to propagate through Zoho's systems (typically 5-15 minutes, but sometimes up to 24 hours).

### Automated Monitoring

A background process is actively monitoring the API status and will notify you when full access is available. This monitor:

- Checks endpoint availability every 30 seconds
- Will continue for up to 30 minutes
- Creates notification files when unlocked
- Logs progress to `~/zoho_api_unlock_monitor.log`

## üöÄ Current Capabilities

Despite the API limitations, you can still use these commands:

```bash
pulser_mail_status    # Check mail configuration status
pulser_mail_refresh   # Refresh OAuth token
pulser_mail_aliases   # Show available email aliases
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Capabilities (Once Unlocked)

Once the API fully unlocks, you'll gain these additional capabilities:

```bash
pulser_mail_internal  # Send internal email
pulser_mail_external  # Send external email
pulser_mail_test      # Run comprehensive API tests
```

## üîÑ Testing Unlock Status

To check if the API has been fully unlocked:

```bash
/Users/tbwa/test_zoho_unlock.sh
```

This script will check the current unlock status and run appropriate tests based on API availability.

## üèóÔ∏è Zoho Cliq Integration

While waiting for full Mail API access, you can begin configuring the Cliq integration using the provisioning templates:

1. `/Users/tbwa/zoho_cliq_provisioning.yaml` - Base configuration for Cliq
2. `/Users/tbwa/zoho_cliq_mail_integration.yaml` - Mail-Cliq integration specifics
3. `/Users/tbwa/zoho_mail_cliq_handler.py` - Python handler for integration logic

These files provide a foundation that will activate once the Mail API is fully unlocked.

## üß® Troubleshooting

If the Mail API hasn't unlocked after 30 minutes:

1. Verify in Zoho Admin Console that the Standard Plan is active
2. Try refreshing your access token with `pulser_mail_refresh`
3. Contact Zoho support with the specific error: `URL_RULE_NOT_CONFIGURED`
4. Restart the monitoring process with:
   ```bash
   /Users/tbwa/run_zoho_monitor_background.sh
   ```

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Wait** for the API to fully unlock (monitor will notify you)
2. **Run** the unlock test script when notified
3. **Configure** Zoho Cliq based on the provisioning templates
4. **Deploy** the integration between Mail and Cliq
