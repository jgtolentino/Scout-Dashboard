## 🔍 Technical Analysis

The Zoho Mail API integration is partially operational. We have successfully:

1. Configured OAuth credentials with the correct scopes
2. Obtained valid access and refresh tokens
3. Authenticated with the API using `Zoho-oauthtoken` format
4. Retrieved basic account information

However, several API endpoints return `URL_RULE_NOT_CONFIGURED` errors. This indicates:

1. The account is likely on a free tier or lacks API permissions
2. The domain setup is incomplete in Zoho Mail Admin Console
3. API access may require additional activation steps

## 🛠️ Next Steps

### For Full Access:
1. Log in to the [Zoho Mail Admin Console](https://mailadmin.zoho.com)
2. Verify `insightpulseai.com` is configured with a business-tier plan
3. Check API access settings in your Zoho account
4. Escalate to Zoho support if needed (reference API error: `URL_RULE_NOT_CONFIGURED`)

### For Current Limited Use:
1. The system can detect mail accounts
2. The system can enumerate folders
3. Basic mail presence can be verified
