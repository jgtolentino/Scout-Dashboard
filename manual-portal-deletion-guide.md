## üéØ Deletion Strategy

### Phase 1: Export Critical Data
Before deleting through portal:
1. **Download** any important files from Storage Accounts
2. **Copy** Key Vault secrets (view and save manually)
3. **Export** database schemas if needed

### Phase 2: Delete Non-Critical First
1. Delete empty resource groups
2. Delete test/dev resources
3. Delete networking resources

### Phase 3: Delete Storage Last
1. Verify backups complete
2. Delete storage accounts
3. Delete key vaults

## üí° Portal Tips

### Speed Up Deletion:
1. Open multiple browser tabs
2. Start deletion on different resource groups simultaneously
3. Deletions run in background

### If "Delete" is Grayed Out:
- Resource may have dependencies
- Delete child resources first
- Try deleting the parent resource group instead

### Track Progress:
- Azure Portal ‚Üí Notifications (bell icon)
- Shows deletion progress
- Confirms when complete
